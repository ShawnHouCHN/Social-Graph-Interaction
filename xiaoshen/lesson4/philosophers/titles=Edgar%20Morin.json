He holds degrees in history, economics, and law. Though less well known in the United States due to the limited availability of English translations of his over 60 books, Morin is renowned in the French speaking world, Europe, and Latin America.\n\n== Biography ==\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Morin's family migrated from the Greek city of [[Salonica]] (Thessaloniki) to [[Marseille]]<ref>Edgar Morin, V\u00e9ronique Nahoum-Grappe, Ha\u00efm Vidal Sephiha (1989) \"Vidal et les siens\", Paris: Seuil, 317 pages.</ref> and later to [[Paris]], where Edgar was born. He is of Judeo-Spanish ([[Sephardi Jews|Sefardi]]) origin.\n\nWhen the Germans invaded France in 1940, Edgar assisted refugees and joined the French Resistance.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Morin|first1=Edgar|last2=Boukhardi|first2=Sophie|title=Talking to Edgar Morin: Defining dialogue|journal=UNESCO: the new Courier|date=January 2004|pages=8\u201311}}</ref> As a member of the [[French Resistance]] he adopted the pseudonym ''Morin'', which he would use for the rest of his life. He joined the [[French Communist Party]] in 1941.\n\nIn 1945, Morin married Violette Chapellaubeau and they lived in [[Landau]], where he served as a Lieutenant in the French Occupation army in Germany.\n\nIn 1946, he returned to Paris and gave up his military career to pursue his activities with the Communist party. Due to his critical posture, his relationship with the party gradually deteriorated until he was expelled in 1951 after he published an article in ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]''. In the same year, he was admitted to the National Center of Scientific Research ([[CNRS]]).\n\nMorin founded and directed the magazine ''{{ill|fr|Arguments (journal)|Arguments|Arguments}}'' (1954\u20131962). In 1959 his book ''Autocritique'' was published. The book was a sustained reflection on his adherence to, and subsequent exit from, the Communist party focusing on the dangers of ideology and self-deception.\n\nIn 1960, Morin travelled extensively in Latin America, visiting [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]] and [[Mexico]].He returned to France where he published ''L'Esprit du Temps', a work on popular culture.\n\nThat same year, French sociologist [[Georges Friedmann]] brought him and [[Roland Barthes]] together to create a Centre for the Study of Mass Communication that, after several name-changes, became the [[Edgar Morin Centre]] of the [[EHESS]], Paris.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=iiac |title=Centre Edgar-Morin |url=http://www.iiac.cnrs.fr/cetsah/spip.php?article207 |accessdate=2010-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091023005003/http://www.iiac.cnrs.fr/cetsah/spip.php?article207 |archivedate=October 23, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1960 he co-authored the film [[Chronique d'un \u00e9t\u00e9]] with [[Jean Rouch]] an early example of ''[[cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]]'' and [[Direct Cinema|direct cinema]].\n\nBeginning in 1965, Morin became involved in a large multidisciplinary project, financed by the D\u00e9l\u00e9gation G\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 la Recherche Scientifique et Technologique in [[Ploz\u00e9vet]].\n\nIn 1968, Morin replaced [[Henri Lefebvre]] at the [[University of Paris X: Nanterre|University of Nanterre]]. He became involved in the student revolts that began to emerge in France. In May 1968 he wrote a series of articles for [[Le Monde]] that tried to understand what he called \"The Student Commune.\" He followed [[May 1968 in France|the student revolt]] closely and wrote a second series of articles in Le Monde called \"The Revolution without a Face,\" as well as co-authoring ''Mai 68: La br\u00e8che'' with [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] and [[Claude Lefort]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Van Herpen |first=Marcel |title =PARIS MAY \u201968 AND PROVO AMSTERDAM \u201865 |url =http://www.cicerofoundation.org/lectures/Marcel_Van_Herpen_May_68_and_Provo_Amsterdam_65.pdf | pages=19 |accessdate =2010-01-23}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969 Morin spent a year at the [[Salk Institute|Salk Institute for Biological Studies]] in [[La Jolla]], California.\n\nIn 1983 he published ''De la nature de l\u2019URSS,'' which deepened his analysis of Soviet communism and anticipated the [[Perestroika]] of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].\n\nIn 2002 Morin participated in the creation of the [[Collegium International|International Ethical, Scientific and Political Collegium]]. In this year, he also had a trip to Iran with Dariush Shayegan.\n\n==Work==\nIn addition to being the [[UNESCO]] Chair of Complex Thought, he is known as a founder of [[transdisciplinarity]] and is the holder of a diverse array of honorary doctorates in a variety of social science fields from no fewer than 21 universities (Messina, Geneva, Milan, Bergamo, Thessaloniki, La Paz, Odense, Perugia, Cosenza, Palermo, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Universit\u00e9 de Laval \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, Brussels, Barcelona, Guadalajara, Valencia, Vera Cruz, Santiago, the Catholic University of Porto Alegre, the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, Candido Mendes University (Rio de Janeiro))<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Montuori|first1=Alfonso|title=COMPLEX THOUGHT An Overview of Edgar Morin\u2019s Intellectual Journey|journal=MetaIntegral Foundation|date=June 2013|volume=Resource Paper}}</ref>\n\nThe [[University of Messina]] in Sicily, Ricardo Palma University in Lima, and the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)]], the prestigious French National Research Center in Paris, have established research centers based on his transdisciplinary methods and philosophy.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Montuori|first1=Alfonso|title=COMPLEX THOUGHT An Overview of Edgar Morin\u2019s Intellectual Journey|journal=MetaIntegral Foundation|date=June 2013|volume=Resource Paper}}</ref> In addition, a university was established recently in Mexico based on his work, [[Multiversidad Mundo Real Edgar Morin]].\n\nHe did not embrace the French [[Postmodern philosophy|postmodern]] or [[poststructuralist]] movements and instead pursued his own research agenda. As a result, US academics did not transport his theories into disciplinary discourses in same fashion as they did Foucault and Derrida, and he did not slide into the heredities of traditional academic disciplines in the 1980s and 1990s. His work spans scholarly and popular literature, and he has graced the cover of multiple publications including [http://www.scienceshumaines.com/edgar-morin-l-aventure-d-une-pensee_fr_497.htm Sciences Humaines] and a special issue of [http://boutique.lemonde.fr/le-monde-hors-serie-edgar-morin.html Le Monde].\n\nAccording to Alfonso Montuori in \"Edgar Morin: A partial introduction\" <blockquote> \"The 5 volume Method is perhaps Morin\u2019s culminating work, a remarkable and seemingly inexhaustible treasure trove of insights, reflection, and a real manual for those who are interested in broadening the nature of human inquiry. Drawing on [[cybernetics]], [[information theory]], [[systems theory]], but also integrating all the work he has done before, from the work on imagination in his research on movies to his profound reflections on death, Method integrates Morin\u2019s journey and provides the reader with an alternative to the traditional assumptions and method of inquiry of our time.\".\n</blockquote>\n\n== Works ==\n\n=== Books ===\n* 1951, ''L\u2019Homme et la mort''\n* 1956, ''Le cin\u00e9ma ou l'homme imaginaire''\n* 1957, ''Les Stars''\n* 1962, ''L'Esprit du temps''\n* 1969, ''La Rumeur d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans''\n* 1967, ''Commune en France: La M\u00e9tamorphose de Plodemet''\n* ''La M\u00e9thode'' (6 volumes)\n** 1977, ''La Nature de la nature''\n** 1980, ''La Vie de la vie''\n** 1986, ''La Connaissance de la connaissance''\n** 1991, ''Les Id\u00e9es''\n** 2001, ''L\u2019Humanit\u00e9 de l\u2019humanit\u00e9''\n** 2004, ''L'\u00c9thique complexe''\n* 1970, ''Journal de Californie''\n* 1973, ''Le paradigme perdu: la nature humaine\n* 1981, ''Pour sortir du si\u00e8cle XX''\n* 1982, ''Science avec conscience''\n* 1983, ''De la nature de l\u2019URSS''\n* 1988, ''Penser L'Europe''\n* 1990, ''Introduction \u00e0 la pens\u00e9e complexe''\n* 1993, ''Terre-patrie''\n* 1994, ''Mes d\u00e9mons''\n* 1994, ''La Complexit\u00e9 humaine''\n* 1997, ''Comprendre la complexit\u00e9 dans les organisations de soins''\n* 1999, ''L\u2019Intelligence de la complexit\u00e9''\n* 1999, ''Relier les connaissances''\n* 1999, ''La T\u00eate bien faite''\n* 2000, ''Les Sept savoirs n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l'\u00e9ducation du futur''\n* 2001, ''Journal de Ploz\u00e9vet, Bretagne''\n* 2002, ''Pour une politique de civilisation''\n* 2002, ''Dialogue sur la connaissance.
