Overcoming these early hardships, Onfray graduated with a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in philosophy. He taught this subject to senior students at a technical high school in [[Caen]] between 1983 and 2002, before establishing what he and his supporters call the ''[[Universit\u00e9 populaire de Caen]]'', proclaiming its foundation on a free-of-charge basis and on the manifesto written by Onfray in 2004 (''La communaut\u00e9 philosophique'').\n\nOnfray's ''Trait\u00e9 d'Ath\u00e9ologie'' \"became the number one best-selling nonfiction book in France for months when it was published in the Spring of 2005 (the word 'atheologie' Onfray borrowed from Georges Bataille). This book repeated its popular French success in Italy, where it was published in September 2005 and quickly soared to number one on Italy's bestseller lists.\"<ref name='Ireland'/>\n\nIn the 2002 election, Onfray endorsed the French [[Revolutionary Communist League (France)|Revolutionary Communist League]] and its candidate for the [[President of the French Republic|French presidency]], [[Olivier Besancenot]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In 2007, he endorsed [[Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9]], but eventually voted for Olivier Besancenot, and conducted an interview with the future French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], whom he declared was an \"ideological enemy\" for ''Philosophie Magazine''.<ref>Nicolas Sarkozy et Michel Onfray - CONFIDENCES ENTRE ENNEMIS http://www.philomag.com/article,dialogue,nicolas-sarkozy-et-michel-onfray-confidences-entre-ennemis,288.php</ref>\n\nOnfray himself attributes the birth of philosophic communities such as the ''[[Popular Education#France|universit\u00e9 populaire]]'' to the results of the [[French presidential election, 2002]].\n\nHis book ''Le cr\u00e9puscule d'une idole : L'affabulation freudienne'' (''The Twilight of an Idol: The Freudian Confabulation''), published in 2010, has been the subject of considerable controversy in France because of its criticism of Freud. He recognizes Freud as a philosopher, but he brings attention to the considerable cost of Freud's treatments and casts doubts on the effectiveness of his methods.<ref>http://www.lexpress.fr/culture/livre/un-psychanalyste-reagit-au-crepuscule-d-une-idole-de-michel-onfray_886463.html</ref> He is an atheist<ref name=\"Ireland\"/> and author of ''[[Atheist Manifesto: The Case Against Christianity, Judaism, and Islam|Atheist Manifesto]]''.\n\nIn 2015, he published \"Cosmos\", the first book of a trilogy. Onfray considers ironically that it constitutes his \"very first book\".<ref>http://www.philomag.com/les-livres/lessai-du-mois/cosmos-une-ontologie-materialiste-11291</ref>\n\n== Philosophy ==\nOnfray writes that there is no philosophy without self-[[psychoanalysis]].  He describes himself as an [[atheist]]<ref name=HAA /> and considers [[Theism|theist]] [[religion]] to be indefensible.  He regards himself as being part of the tradition of [[individualist anarchism]], a tradition that he claims is at work throughout the entire history of philosophy and that he is seeking to revive amidst modern schools of philosophy that he regards as [[Cynicism (philosophy)|cynical]].\n\n=== View on the history of Western philosophy and philosophical project ===\nOnfray has published 9 books under a project of [[history of philosophy]] called ''Counter-history of Philosophy''. In each of these books Onfray deals with a particular historical period in western philosophy. The series of books are composed by the titles I. ''Les Sagesses Antiques'' (2006) (on western antiquity), II. ''Le Christianisme h\u00e9doniste'' (2006) (on [[Christian hedonism]] from the Renaissance period), III. ''Les libertins baroques'' (2007) (on [[libertine]] thought from the [[Baroque era]]), IV. ''Les Ultras des Lumi\u00e8res'' (2007) (on radical enlightenment thought), V. ''L'Eud\u00e9monisme social'' (2008) (on radical [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] and [[Eudomonia|eudomonistic]] thought), VI. ''Les Radicalit\u00e9s existentielles'' (2009) (on 19th and 20th century radical [[existentialist]] thinkers) and VII.''La construction du surhomme: [[Jean-Marie Guyau]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'' (on Guyau\u00b4s and Nietzsche\u00b4s philosophy in relation to the concept of the ''[[\u00dcbermensch]]''). VIII ''Les Freudiens h\u00e9r\u00e9tiques'' (2013). IX ''Les Consciences r\u00e9fractaires'' (2013).\n\nIn an interview he establishes his view on the history of philosophy. For him:\n<blockquote>\nThere is in fact a multitude of ways to practice philosophy, but out of this multitude, the dominant historiography picks one tradition among others and makes it the truth of philosophy: that is to say the [[idealist]], spiritualist lineage compatible with the [[Judeo-Christian]] world view. From that point on, anything that crosses this partial \u2013 in both senses of the word \u2013 view of things finds itself dismissed. This applies to nearly all non-Western philosophies, Oriental wisdom in particular, but also sensualist, empirical, [[materialist]], [[nominalist]], [[hedonistic]] currents and everything that can be put under the heading of \"anti-[[Plato]]nic philosophy\". Philosophy that comes down from the heavens is the kind that \u2013 from Plato to [[Emmanuel Levinas|Levinas]] by way of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Christianity]] \u2013 needs a world behind the scenes to understand, explain and justify this world. The other line of force rises from the earth because it is satisfied with the given world, which is already so much.<ref name=\"portal.unesco.org\">[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0019/001921/192178e.pdf Michel Onfray: A philosopher of the Enlightenment]</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n\"His mission is to rehabilitate materialist and sensualist thinking and use it to re-examine our relationship to the world. Approaching philosophy as a reflection of each individual's personal experience, Onfray inquires into the capabilities of the body and its senses and calls on us to celebrate them through music, painting, and [[fine cuisine]].\"<ref>[http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/a/a_03/a_03_s/a_03_s_que/a_03_s_que.html THE PHILOSOPHIES OF PLEASURE]</ref>\n\n=== Hedonism ===\n{{Hedonism| Thinkers}} He defines hedonism \"as an introspective attitude to life based on taking pleasure yourself and pleasuring others, without harming yourself or anyone else.\"<ref>[http://newhumanist.org.uk/1421 \"Atheism \u00e0 la mode\"]</ref> \"Onfray's philosophical project is to define an ethical hedonism, a joyous [[utilitarianism]], and a generalized [[aesthetic]] of sensual [[materialism]] that explores how to use the brain's and the body's capacities to their fullest extent &ndash; while restoring philosophy to a useful role in art, politics, and everyday life and decisions.\"<ref name='Ireland'/>\n\nOnfray's works \"have explored the philosophical resonances and components of (and challenges to) science, painting, gastronomy, sex and sensuality, bioethics, wine, and writing. His most ambitious project is his projected six-volume ''Counter-history of Philosophy''\",<ref name='Ireland'/> of which three have been published.\n\nFor Onfray:\n\n<blockquote>In opposition to the ascetic ideal advocated by the dominant school of thought, hedonism suggests identifying the highest good with your own pleasure and that of others; the one must never be indulged at the expense of sacrificing the other. Obtaining this balance \u2013 my pleasure at the same time as the pleasure of others \u2013 presumes that we approach the subject from different angles \u2013 political, ethical, aesthetic, erotic, bioethical, pedagogical, historiographical....<ref name=\"portal.unesco.org\"/></blockquote>\n\nHis philosophy aims for \"micro-revolutions\", or \"revolutions of the individual and small groups of like-minded people who live by his hedonistic, libertarian values.\"<ref>[http://www.ainfos.ca/06/dec/ainfos00234.html (en) France, Media, Michel Onfray, A self labeled Anarchist Philosopher]</ref>\n\n=== Anarchism ===\n{{Individualism sidebar}}\nRecently Michel Onfray has embraced the term [[postanarchism]] to describe his approach to politics and ethics.<ref>[http://www.maglm.fr/post/2009/11/08/Michel-Onfray-:-le-post-anarchisme-explique-a-ma-grand-mere Michel Onfray : le post anarchisme expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 ma grand-m\u00e8re]</ref> He advocates for an anarchism in line with such intellectuals as \"[[George Orwell|Orwell]], ''la philosophe'' [[Simone Weil]], [[Jean Grenier]], ''la French Theory avec'' [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Deleuze]], [[Bourdieu]], [[Guattari]], [[Lyotard]], ''le'' [[Derrida]] ''de'' ''Politiques de l'amiti\u00e9'' et du ''Droit \u00e0 la philosophie'', ''mais aussi'' [[Mai 68]]\" which for him was \"a [[Nietzsche]]an revolt in order to put an end to the \"One\" truth, revealed, and to put in evidence the diversity of truths, in order to make disappear ascetic Christian ideas and to help arise new possibilities of existence\".<ref>\"qu'il consid\u00e8re comme une r\u00e9volte nietzsch\u00e9enne pour avoir mis fin \u00e0 la V\u00e9rit\u00e9 \"Une\", r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e, en mettant en \u00e9vidence la diversit\u00e9 de v\u00e9rit\u00e9s, pour avoir fait dispara\u00eetre les id\u00e9aux asc\u00e9tiques chr\u00e9tiens et fait surgir de nouvelles possibilit\u00e9s d'existence.\"[http://www.maglm.fr/post/2009/11/08/Michel-Onfray-:-le-post-anarchisme-explique-a-ma-grand-mere Michel Onfray : le post anarchisme expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 ma grand-m\u00e8re]</ref>\n\n==== Relation to hedonism ====\nIn ''La puissance d'exister: Manifeste h\u00e9doniste'', Onfray claims that the political dimension of hedonism runs from [[Epicurus]] to [[John Stuart Mill]] through [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[Claude Adrien Helv\u00e9tius]]. What political hedonism aims for is to create ''the greatest happiness for the greatest numbers''.\n\n=== Atheism ===\n{{Criticism of Christianity sidebar| Critics}}\n\nBlogger J. M.

Ancient Historian [[John Dickson (author)|John Dickson]], of Macquarie University, has said that [[Philo|Philo of Alexandria]], writing about the time of Jesus, says that sometimes the Romans handed the bodies of crucifixion victims over to family members for proper burial. The Roman Jewish historian [[Josephus|Flavius Josephus]] even remarks: \"the Jews are so careful about funeral rites that even malefactors who have been sentenced to crucifixion are taken down and buried before sunset\".<ref>[Josephus, Jewish War 4.317]</ref> Regarding the second claim, Dickson calls this a \"clear historical blunder\".<ref>[http://www.anchist.mq.edu.au/doccentre/SSEC/newslettersforms/Newsletter61.pdf The Nouveau Atheists on the Historical Jesus]</ref>\n\n== The ''Universit\u00e9 Populaire'' ==\nOnfray was a high school philosophy teacher for two decades until he resigned in 2002 to establish a tuition-free [[Universit\u00e9 populaire de Caen|Universit\u00e9 Populaire (People's University) at Caen]], at which he and several colleagues teach philosophy and other subjects.<ref name='Ireland'/>\n\n<blockquote>\"The Universit\u00e9 Populaire, which is open to all who cannot access the state university system, and on principle does not accept any money from the State -- Onfray uses the profits from his books to help finance it -- has had enormous success.
