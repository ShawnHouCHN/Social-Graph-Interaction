Cartwright moved to Hollywood in 1978 and trained alongside voice actor [[Daws Butler]]. Her first professional role was voicing Gloria in the animated series ''[[Richie Rich (1980 TV series)|Richie Rich]]'', which she followed with a starring role in the television movie ''[[Marian Rose White]]'' (1982) and her first feature film, ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]'' (1983).\n\nAfter continuing to search for acting work, in 1987 Cartwright auditioned for a role in [[The Simpsons shorts|a series of animated shorts]] about a [[dysfunctional family]] that was to appear on ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]''. Cartwright intended to audition for the role of [[Lisa Simpson]], the middle child; when she arrived at the audition, she found the role of Bart\u2014Lisa's brother\u2014to be more interesting. [[Matt Groening]], the series' creator, allowed her to audition for Bart and offered her the role on the spot. She voiced Bart for three seasons on ''The Tracey Ullman Show'', and in 1989, the shorts were spun off into a half-hour show called ''[[The Simpsons]]''.
