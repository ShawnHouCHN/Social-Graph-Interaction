In a vast oeuvre of essays, Svit\u00e1k addressed questions of democracy and socialism, of art in bureaucratic and consumer societies, and of the \"unbearable burden\" of political catastrophe in Czech history.<ref>''The Unbearable Burden of History: The Sovietization of Czechoslovakia'', Academia, 1990.</ref> In addition, Svit\u00e1k wrote an extensive body of fiction and poetry, in which he \"sought a unity of philosophy, literature, and politics, a unity of engagement, wisdom, and poetry.\"<ref>''Nev\u011bdeck\u00e1 antropologie : dialectica modo bohemico demonstrata'' (\"Unscientific Anthropology\"), Chico, California, 1984, p. 194.</ref> In this, Svit\u00e1k consciously followed in the footsteps of the [[surrealism|surrealist]] movement that he admired and critically defended on numerous occasions<ref>e.g. \"The Surrealist Image of Humankind,\" ''Cultural Correspondence'', No. 12-13-14, 1981</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, Svit\u00e1k was one of [[Czechoslovakia]]'s most vocal advocates of [[Prague Spring|democratic socialism]] (a distinction he shared with [[Karel Kos\u00edk]], Czechoslovakia's other prominent Marxist humanist philosopher). After the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968, Svit\u00e1k was stripped of his citizenship and sentenced to a lengthy jail term. Instead of serving the jail term, he chose to emigrate,<ref>As reported by Svit\u00e1k himself on the jacket of books published after that period.</ref> first to [[New York]] and in 1970 to [[Chico, California]], where he was offered an academic position. Svit\u00e1k worked at [[Cal State Chico]] until 1990, when he returned to Czechoslovakia after the end of [[Communist Party]] rule. In the early 1990s Svit\u00e1k remained a staunch proponent of [[democratic socialism]], turning his critical pen to the new, [[post-Communist]] regime.<ref>''Ztracen\u00e9 iluze : v\u00fdro\u010dn\u00ed zpr\u00e1va o sametov\u00e9 revoluci'', Prague 1990.</ref> He died in [[Prague]] in 1994.\n\n== Selected Publications in English ==\n\n* ''Man and his World: A Marxian View'', New York, Dell Pub.
