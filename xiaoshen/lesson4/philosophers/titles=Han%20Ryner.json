He wrote for publications such as ''L'Art social'', ''L'Humanit\u00e9 nouvelle'', ''L'Ennemi du Peuple'', ''L'Id\u00e9e Libre de Lorulot''; and ''L'En dehors'' and ''L'Unique'' of fellow anarchist individualist [[\u00c9mile Armand]]. His thought is mainly influenced by [[stoicism]] and [[epicureanism]].\n\n== Life ==\n\nHe was born in Nemours (now Ghazaouet, [[Tlemcen Province]]), Department of Or\u00e1n, [[French Algeria]] in a modest religious family. After the death of his mother, he abandoned Catholicism, associated himself with Freemasons and started having an interest in social ideas.\n\nHe published 2 novels in 1894\u20131895 and later started working as a journalist. After that he took a teaching position but struggled at having to fit into such a disciplined environment. He becomes a prolific literary writer.\n\nIn 1896, he adopted the pseudonym \"Han Ryner\" and started writing for such magazines as ''L'Art social'', ''L'Humanit\u00e9 nouvelle'' of Augustin Hamon, ''L'Ennemi du Peuple'' of [[Emile Janvion]] and ''L'Id\u00e9e Libre''. From here he started collaborating in the important individualist anarchist magazine ''[[L'EnDehors]]'' and ''L'Unique'' of [[\u00c9mile Armand]].\n\nIn 1900 he wrote the essay ''Le crime d'ob\u00e9ir'' (the crime of obeying) and in 1903 he wrote the essay ''Petit manuel individualiste'', in which he presented his anarchist individualist doctrine influenced by classic Greek [[stoicism]] in the works of [[Epictetus]]. By the 1920s his thought starts having an important influence in Spain within individualist anarchist circles especially through the translations of his work by Juan Elizalde. Han Ryner started writing in Spanish individualist journals such as ''\u00c9tica'', which already had an important influence of the thought of Ryner.<ref name=\"spain\">[http://www.acracia.org/xdiez.html \"Voluntary non-submission.

Han Ryner embraces pacifist and anti-war positions and promotes [[Conscientious objector|conscience objection]]. In his anti-war activism he collaborates with [[\u00c9mile Armand]].\n\nHe campaigned for the liberation of [[Eug\u00e8ne Dieudonn\u00e9]] in 1913; for that of [[\u00c9mile Armand]] during the war; for the mutiny in the Black Sea, and for the Italian-American anarchists [[Nicola Sacco]] and [[Bartolomeo Vanzetti]] and for the Ukrainian anarchist [[Nestor Makhno]]. A radical [[anticlericalism|anticlerical]], he adhered to the [[World Committee against War and Fascism]]. He also opposed World War I on pacifist anti militaristic grounds. He was a rare case of an anarchist participating in the [[F\u00e9librige]]. He died in Paris on February 6, 1938.\n\n== The individualist anarchism of Han Ryner ==\n{{Individualism sidebar}} \nThe mature thought of Han Ryner is influenced by [[stoicism]] and [[epicureanism]]. From this first position he shows a tendency to fatalism towards the pains of life and those produced by society. He wrote in \"Mini-manual of individualism\", \"The Stoic [[Epictetus]] courageously bore poverty and slavery. He was perfectly happy in the situations most painful to ordinary men.\"<ref name=\"manual\">[http://www.marxists.org/archive/ryner/1905/mini-manual.htm \"Mini-Manual of Individualism\" by Han Ryner]</ref> He then emphasized subjective will as a power which individuals can resort to.\n\nHe defined individualism as \"the moral doctrine which, relying on no dogma, no tradition, no external determination, appeals only to the individual conscience\".<ref name=\"manual\"/> As models of individualists he names [[Socrates]], [[Epicurus]], [[Jesus]] and Epictetus<ref name=\"manual\"/> and so these persons exemplify what he defines as \"harmonic individualism\".<ref name=\"raforum\">[http://raforum.info/spip.php?article842&lang=fr LECHA, G\u00e9rard. \"Han Ryner or the Social Thinking of an Individualist in the Early Part of the 20th Century\" ]</ref> For example, he admires from Epicurus his temperance and that \"he showed that very little was needed to satisfy hunger and thirst, to defend oneself against heat and the cold. And he liberated himself from all other needs, that is, almost all the desires and all the fears that enslave men.\".<ref name=\"manual\"/> From Jesus how \"He lived free and a wanderer, foreign to any social ties. He was the enemy of priests, external cults and, in general, all organizations.\"<ref name=\"manual\"/> From these individualists as he defines them he distinguishes \"conquering and aggressive egoists who proclaim themselves to be individualists\" such as [[Stendhal]] and [[Nietzsche]].\n\nHan Ryner, as well as fellow French individualist anarchist [[\u00c9mile Armand]], regarded individualist anarchism above all as a way of life. He regarded that the individualist act must be in accord with his ideas and he calls that \"[[virtue]]\".<ref name=\"manual\"/> For him, disinterested virtue creates happiness which for him meant feeling oneself free of all outside servitudes and in perfect accord with oneself.<ref name=\"manual\"/>\n\nIn relationships with others and things outside the individual he saw \"Every person is a goal, an end\"<ref name=\"manual\"/> and from this he saw that he can \"ask people for services that they will freely accord me, either through benevolence or in exchange for other services\".<ref name=\"manual\"/> He defined society as \"a gathering of individuals for a common labor.\" From society's evils he advocated developing individual resistance towards building up indifference.<ref name=\"manual\"/> He understood happiness as something that can only be reached through oneself and sees that \"Society has stolen from all, in order to turn over to a few, that great instrument of natural labor, the earth.\" He rejected crowds as he sees them as \"the most brutal of natural forces.\"<ref name=\"manual\"/>\n\nHe saw work as an evil worsened by society and that \"1\u2014It arbitrarily dispenses a certain number of men from all work and places their part of the burden on other men. 2\u2014It employs many men at useless labors and social functions. 3\u2014It multiplies among all, and particularly among the rich, imaginary needs and it imposes on the poor the odious labor necessary for the satisfaction of these needs.\"<ref name=\"manual\"/>\n\nIn line with Stirner, he rejected sacrifices in the name of exterior \"Idols\" such as \"In certain countries, the King or the Emperor, in others some fraud called the Will of the People. Everywhere Order, the Political party, Religion, the Fatherland, the Race, the Color.<ref name=\"manual\"/>\" By color he meant race and he found deplorable that \"The White color especially ... has managed to unite in one cult the French, Germans, Russians, and Italians and to obtain from these noble priests the bloody sacrifice of a great number of Chinese.... It is they who have made all of Africa a hell. It is they who destroyed the Indians of America and lynches Negroes.\"<ref name=\"manual\"/>\n\n== Written works ==\n* ''Chair vaincue, roman psychologique'' (1889)\n* ''Les Chants du divorce, po\u00e9sies'' (1892)\n* ''L'Humeur inqui\u00e8te'' (1894)\n* ''La Folie de mis\u00e8re'' (1895)\n* ''Le Crime d'ob\u00e9ir'' (1900)\n* ''Le Soup\u00e7on'' (1900)\n* ''L'Homme fourmi'', roman illustr\u00e9 par [[Alexis M\u00e9rodack-Jeanneau]] (1901)\n* ''Les Voyages de Psychodore, philosophe cynique'' (1903) (translated by [[Brian Stableford]] and included in ''The Superhumans'', q.v.)\n* ''Petit Manuel individualiste'' (1903)\n* ''La Fille manqu\u00e9e'' (1903) R\u00e9\u00e9d.
