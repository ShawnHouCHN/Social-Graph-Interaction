Prof. Giacomo Marramao}}</ref> member of the Coll\u00e8ge International de Philosophie of Paris, professor honoris causa at the [[University of Bucharest]] and Visiting Professor of Political Theory in Paris (Sciences Po.). He is Director (with Silvana Borutti) of \"Paradigmi\" - a magazine of critical philosophy - and Director of the Fondazione Basso in Rome. Many of his books have been translated into foreign languages, such as ''Kairos: Towards an Ontology of Due Time'' (Davies), ''The Passage West: Philosophy After the Age of the Nation State'' (Verso), ''Against the Power: Philosophy and Writing'' (John Cabot University Press), ''The Bewitched World of Capital'' (Brill - forthcoming).\n\nAwards: in 2005, the Presidency of the French Republic has awarded him with the \"Palmes Acad\u00e9miques\". In 2009, he received the International Price of Philosophy \"Karl-Otto Apel\", and in 2013 the title of Doctor honoris causa by the Universidad Nacional de Cordoba (Argentine).\n\n==Works==\nIn his book ''Marxism and Revisionism in Italy'' (1971) he regards [[Gentile]]'s thought as the philosophical keystone of Italian Marxism. He is the author of ''The Political and the Transformations'' (1979) and ''Power and Secularization'' (1985). He has been one of the most important re-discoverers of [[Carl Schmitt]]'s thought and of [[decisionism]].\n\nIn 2006 a collection of essays was published to celebrate his 60th birthday (Figure del conflitto, Valter Casini Editore, Roma), with international contributions by, among others: [[Remo Bodei]], [[Massimo Cacciari]], Franco Rella, [[Manfred Frank]], [[Jean L. Cohen]], [[Adriana Cavarero]], [[Homi K. Bhabha]], [[Antonio Negri]], [[R\u00fcdiger Bubner]], [[Axel Honneth]], [[Marc Aug\u00e9]], Manuel Cruz, Jorge E. Dotti, and [[Salvador Giner]].\n\n==Philosophical stance==\nStarting from the study of Italian and European Marxism (''Marxism and Revisionism in Italy'', 1971; ''Austro-Marxism and left wing Socialism between the two Wars'', 1977), Marramao has analysed the political categories of modernity suggesting \u2013 on the same wavelength as the [[Frankfurt School]] (''The political and its transformations'', 1979) and [[Max Weber]] (''The disenchanted order'', 1985)\u2013 an innovative symbolic-genealogical reconstruction of them. According to this view, which recovers [[Karl L\u00f6with]]'s historical-philosophical hypothesis, in modern forms of social organizations there are settled meanings deriving from a process of secularization of religious contents \u2013 that is, the re-proposal of the Christian symbolic horizon inside a worldly dimension. In particular, secularization finds its centre in a process of \"temporalization of history\" thanks to which the categories of time (that translate Christian [[eschatology]] into a generic opening to the future: progress, revolution, liberation, etc.) gain an increasing centrality in the political representations of Modernity. \n\nBased on these reflections, also exposed in ''After the Leviathan'', 1995 (third edition in 2013) and ''The Passion of the Present'', 2008, a clear thematization of the philosophical problem of time has grown up. In opposition to [[Henri Bergson]]'s and [[Martin Heidegger]]'s views, which delineate with different shades a pure form of temporality, more original than its representations and spatializations, Marramao declares that the link time-space is inseparable and, also connecting to contemporary Physics, he asserts that the structure of Time possesses an aporetic and impure profile, compared to which the dimension of space is the formal reference necessary to think its paradoxes (''Minima temporalia'', 1990, new edition in 2005; ''Kairos: Towards an Ontology of Due Time'', 1992, new edition in 2005).\n\n==Notes==\n<references/> ''Storia della filosofia'', vol. 14: ''Filosofi italiani contemporanei'', Bompiani, Milano, 2008, pp.&nbsp;328\u2013339 (ISBN 9788845264474); AAVV, ''Enciclopedia di filosofia'', Garzanti libri, [[Milano]], 2004; Benso S., ''Marramao\u2019s Kair\u00f3s: The Space of \u201cOur\u201d Time in the Time of Cosmic Disorientation'', in \u201cHuman Studies\u201d, anno 2008, n. 31; A.
