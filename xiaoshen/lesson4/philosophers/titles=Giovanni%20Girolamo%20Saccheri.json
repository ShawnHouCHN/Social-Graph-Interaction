He entered the Jesuit order in 1685, and was ordained as a priest in 1694. He taught philosophy at [[Turin]] from 1694 to 1697, and philosophy, theology, and mathematics at [[Pavia]] from 1697 until his death. He was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the mathematician [[Tommaso Ceva]] and published several works including ''Quaesita geometrica'' (1693), ''Logica demonstrativa'' (1697), and ''Neo-statica'' (1708).\n\nHe is primarily known today for his last publication, in 1733 shortly before his death. Now considered the second work in [[non-Euclidean geometry]], ''Euclides ab omni naevo vindicatus'' (''Euclid Freed of Every Flaw'') languished in obscurity until it was rediscovered by [[Eugenio Beltrami]] in the mid-19th century.\n\nMany of Saccheri's ideas have a precedent in the 11th Century Persian polymath [[Omar Khayy\u00e1m]]'s ''Discussion of Difficulties in Euclid'' (''Ris\u00e2la f\u00ee sharh m\u00e2 ashkala min mus\u00e2dar\u00e2t Kit\u00e2b 'Ugl\u00eedis''), a fact ignored in most Western sources until recently.\n\nIt is unclear whether Saccheri had access to this work in translation, or developed his ideas independently. The [[Saccheri quadrilateral]] is now sometimes referred to as the Khayyam-Saccheri quadrilateral.\n\nThe intent of Saccheri's work was ostensibly to establish the validity of Euclid by means of a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' proof of any alternative to [[Euclid]]'s [[parallel postulate]].  To do this he assumed that the parallel postulate was false, and attempted to derive a contradiction.  \nSince Euclid's postulate is equivalent to the statement that the sum of the internal angles of a triangle is 180\u00b0, he considered both the hypothesis that the angles add up to more or less than 180\u00b0.\n\nThe first led to the conclusion that straight lines are finite, contradicting Euclid's second postulate. So Saccheri correctly rejected it. However, today this principle is accepted as the basis of [[elliptic geometry]], where both the second and fifth postulates are rejected.\n\nThe second possibility turned out to be harder to refute. In fact he was unable to derive a logical contradiction and instead derived many non-intuitive results; for example that triangles have a maximum finite area and that there is an absolute unit of length. He finally concluded that: \"the hypothesis of the acute angle is absolutely false; because it is repugnant to the nature of straight lines\". Today, his results are theorems of [[hyperbolic geometry]].\n\nThere is some minor argument on whether Saccheri really meant this, as he published his work in the final year of his life, came extremely close to discovering non-Euclidean geometry and was a logician. Some believe Saccheri only concluded in such way in an intent to avoid criticism that might come from seemingly illogical aspects of hyperbolic geometry.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Saccheri\u2013Legendre theorem]]\n*[[Hyperbolic geometry]]\n*[[Parallel postulate]]\n*[[List of Jesuit scientists]]\n*[[List of Roman Catholic cleric\u2013scientists]]\n\n==References==\n* [[Martin Gardner]], ''Non-Euclidean Geometry'', Chapter 14 of ''The Colossal Book of Mathematics'', W.
