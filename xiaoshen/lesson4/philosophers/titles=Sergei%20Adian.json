He is a professor at the [[Moscow State University]] and is known for his work in [[group theory]], especially on the [[Burnside's problem|Burnside problem]].\n\n==Biography==\nAdian was born near [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Elizavetpol]]. He grew up there in an [[Armenians|Armenian]] family. He studied at [[Yerevan]] and [[Moscow]] [[pedagogical]] institutes. \nHis advisor was [[Pyotr Novikov]]. He has been working at Moscow State University since 1965. [[Alexander Razborov]] was one of his students.\n\n==Mathematical career==\nIn his first work as a student in 1950, Adian proved that the graph of a function f(x) of a real variable satisfying\nthe functional equation f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) and having discontinuities is\ndense in the plane. (Clearly, all continuous solutions of the equation are linear\nfunctions.) This result was not published at the time. It is curious that about\n25 years later the American mathematician [[Edwin Hewitt]] from Seattle gave\npreprints of some of his papers to Adian during a visit to MSU, one of which\nwas devoted to exactly the same result, which was published by Hewitt much\nlater.\n\nBy the beginning of 1955 Adian had managed to prove the undecidability of practically all non-trivial\ninvariant group properties, including the undecidability of being isomorphic to a\nfixed group G, for any group G. These results made up his Ph.D. thesis and his first published work. This is one of the most\nremarkable, beautiful, and general results in algorithmic group theory and is now known as the [[Adian\u2013Rabin theorem]].\nWhat distinguishes the first published work by Adian, is its completeness. In spite of numerous attempts, nobody\nhas added anything fundamentally new to the results during the past 50 years. Adian\u2019s result was immediately used by A. A. Markov in\nhis proof of the algorithmic unsolvability of the classical problem of deciding when topological manifolds are homeomorphic.\n\n===Burnside problem===\n\nAbout the Burnside problem:\n<blockquote>\nVery much like Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem in number theory, Burnside\u2019s\nproblem has acted as a catalyst for research in group theory. The fascination\nexerted by a problem with an extremely simple formulation which\nthen turns out to be extremely difficult has something irresistible about\nit to the mind of the mathematician.\n</blockquote>\n\nBefore the work of Novikov and Adian an affirmative answer to the problem was known only for n 2 {2, 3, 4, 6} and the matrix groups.\nHowever, this did not\nhinder the belief in an affirmative answer for any period n. The only question was\nto find the right methods for proving it. As later developments showed, this belief\nwas too naive. This just demonstrates that before their work nobody even came\nclose to imagining the nature of the free Burnside group, or the extent to which\nsubtle structures inevitably arose in any serious attempt to investigate it. In fact,\nthere were no methods for proving inequalities in groups given by identities of the\nform X^n = 1.\n\nAn approach to solving the problem in the negative was first outlined by\nP. S. Novikov in his note, which appeared in 1959. However, the concrete\nrealization of his ideas encountered serious difficulties, and in 1960, at the insistence\nof Novikov and his wife Lyudmila Keldysh, Adian settled down to work on\nthe Burnside problem. Completing the project took intensive efforts from both\ncollaborators in the course of eight years, and in 1968 their famous paper\nappeared, containing a negative solution of the problem for all odd periods\nn > 4381, and hence for all multiples of those odd integers as well.\n\nThe solution of the Burnside problem was certainly one of the most outstanding\nand deep mathematical results of the past century. At the same time, this result\nis one of the hardest theorems: just the inductive step of a complicated induction\nused in the proof took up a whole issue of volume 32 of Izvestiya, even lengthened\nby 30 pages. In many respects the work was literally carried to its conclusion by\nthe exceptional persistence of Adian. In that regard it is worth recalling the words\nof Novikov, who said that he had never met a mathematician more \u2018penetrating\u2019\nthan Adian.\n\nIn contrast to the Adian\u2013Rabin theorem, the paper of Adian and Novikov in no way \u2018closed\u2019 the Burnside problem. Moreover,\nover a long period of more than ten years Adian continued to improve and simplify\nthe method they had created and also to adapt the method for solving some other\nfundamental problems in group theory.\n\nBy the beginning of the 1980s, when other contributors\nappeared who mastered the Novikov\u2013Adian method, the theory already\nrepresented a powerful method for constructing and investigating new groups (both\nperiodic and non-periodic) with interesting properties prescribed.\n\n== External links ==\n* {{ru icon}} ''[http://www.mi.ras.ru/~razborov/adian75.pdf On 75th birthday]'' \u2013 an article by L.
