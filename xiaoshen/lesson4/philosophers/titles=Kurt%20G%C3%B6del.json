Considered with [[Aristotle]] and [[Gottlob Frege]] to be one of the most significant logicians in history, G\u00f6del made an immense impact upon scientific and philosophical thinking in the 20th century, a time when others such as [[Bertrand Russell]],<ref name=\"Stanford&Son\">For instance, in their ''[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/principia-mathematica/ Principia Mathematica'']'' (''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' edition).</ref> [[A. N. Whitehead]],<ref name=\"Stanford&Son\"/> and [[David Hilbert]] were pioneering the use of logic and [[set theory]] to understand the [[foundations of mathematics]].\n\nG\u00f6del published his two [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorems]] in 1931 when he was 25 years old, one year after finishing his doctorate at the [[University of Vienna]]. The first incompleteness theorem states that for any self-consistent [[recursive set|recursive]] [[axiomatic system]] powerful enough to describe the arithmetic of the [[natural number]]s (for example [[Peano arithmetic]]), there are true propositions about the naturals that cannot be proved from the [[axioms]]. To prove this theorem, G\u00f6del developed a technique now known as [[G\u00f6del numbering]], which codes formal expressions as natural numbers.\n\nHe also showed that neither the [[axiom of choice]] nor the [[continuum hypothesis]] can be disproved from the accepted [[axiomatic set theory|axioms of set theory]], assuming these axioms are consistent. The former result opened the door for mathematicians to assume the axiom of choice in their proofs. He also made important contributions to [[proof theory]] by clarifying the connections between [[classical logic]], [[intuitionistic logic]], and [[modal logic]].\n\n==Early life and education==\n\n===Childhood===\nG\u00f6del was born April 28, 1906, in Br\u00fcnn, [[Austria-Hungary]] (now [[Brno]], [[Czech Republic]]) into the [[Germans|ethnic German]] family of Rudolf G\u00f6del, the manager of a textile factory, and Marianne G\u00f6del (n\u00e9e Handschuh).<ref>Dawson 1997, pp. 3\u20134</ref> Throughout his life, G\u00f6del would remain close to his mother; their correspondence was frequent and wide-ranging.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/johann-herbart/|title=Johann Friedrich Herbart|last=Kim|first=Alan|date=2015-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2015}}</ref> At the time of his birth the city had a [[German language|German-speaking]] majority<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Br\u00fcnn}}</ref> which included his parents.<ref>Dawson 1997, p. 12</ref> His father was Catholic and his mother was Protestant and the children were raised Protestant. The ancestors of Kurt G\u00f6del were often active in Br\u00fcnn's cultural life. For example, his grandfather Joseph G\u00f6del was a famous singer of that time and for some years a member of the \"Br\u00fcnner M\u00e4nnergesangverein\".<ref>Proch\u00e1zka 2008, pp. 30\u201334.</ref>\n\nG\u00f6del automatically became a Czechoslovak citizen at age 12 when the Austro-Hungarian Empire broke up at the end of World War I. According to his classmate Klepeta\u0159, like many residents of the predominantly German Sudetenl\u00e4nder, \"G\u00f6del considered himself always Austrian and an exile in Czechoslovakia\".<ref>Dawson 1997, p. 15.</ref> He chose to become an [[Austria]]n citizen at age 23{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}. When [[Germany]] [[Anschluss|annexed Austria]] in 1938, G\u00f6del automatically became a German citizen at age 32. After World War II, at the age of 42, he became an American citizen.\n\nIn his family, young Kurt was known as ''Herr Warum'' (\"Mr. Why\") because of his insatiable curiosity. According to his brother Rudolf, at the age of six or seven Kurt suffered from [[rheumatic fever]]; he completely recovered, but for the rest of his life he remained convinced that his heart had suffered permanent damage. Beginning at age four, G\u00f6del suffered from \"frequent episodes of poor health,\" which would continue for his entire life.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/johann-herbart/|title=Johann Friedrich Herbart|last=Kim|first=Alan|date=2015-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2015}}</ref>\n\nG\u00f6del attended the ''Evangelische Volksschule'', a Lutheran school in Br\u00fcnn from 1912 to 1916, and was enrolled in the ''Deutsches Staats-Realgymnasium'' from 1916 to 1924, excelling with honors in all his subjects, particularly in mathematics, languages and religion. Although Kurt had first excelled in languages, he later became more interested in history and mathematics. His interest in mathematics increased when in 1920 his older brother Rudolf (born 1902) left for [[Vienna]] to go to medical school at the [[University of Vienna]]. During his teens, Kurt studied [[Gabelsberger shorthand]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s ''[[Theory of Colours (book)|Theory of Colours]]'' and criticisms of [[Isaac Newton]], and the writings of [[Immanuel Kant]].\n\n===Studying in Vienna===\nAt the age of 18, G\u00f6del joined his brother in Vienna and entered the University of Vienna. By that time, he had already mastered university-level mathematics.<ref>Dawson 1997, p. 24.</ref> Although initially intending to study [[theoretical physics]], he also attended courses on mathematics and philosophy. During this time, he adopted ideas of [[mathematical realism]]. He read [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s ''[[Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science|Metaphysische Anfangsgr\u00fcnde der Naturwissenschaft]]'', and participated in the [[Vienna Circle]] with [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]], and [[Rudolf Carnap]]. G\u00f6del then studied [[number theory]], but when he took part in a seminar run by [[Moritz Schlick]] which studied [[Bertrand Russell]]'s book ''Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy'', he became interested in [[mathematical logic]]. According to G\u00f6del, mathematical logic was \"a science prior to all others, which contains the ideas and principles underlying all sciences.\"<ref>Gleick, J. (2011) ''[[The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood]],'' London, Fourth Estate, p181.</ref>\n\nAttending a lecture by [[David Hilbert]] in [[Bologna]] on completeness and consistency of mathematical systems may have set G\u00f6del's life course. In 1928, Hilbert and [[Wilhelm Ackermann]] published ''Grundz\u00fcge der theoretischen Logik'' (''[[Principles of Mathematical Logic]]''), an introduction to [[first-order logic]] in which the problem of completeness was posed: ''Are the axioms of a formal system sufficient to derive every statement that is true in all models of the system?''\n\nThis became the topic that G\u00f6del chose for his doctoral work. In 1929, at the age of 23, he completed his doctoral [[dissertation]] under Hans Hahn's supervision. In it, he established the completeness of the [[first-order predicate calculus]] ([[G\u00f6del's completeness theorem]]). He was awarded his doctorate in 1930. His thesis, along with some additional work, was published by the Vienna Academy of Science.\n\n==Career==\n\n===The Incompleteness Theorem===\n{|class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 0.5em; margin-right: 0.5em; font-size: 84%; background:#white; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 30%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"| \"Kurt G\u00f6del's achievement in modern logic is singular and monumental \u2013 indeed it is more than a monument, it is a landmark which will remain visible far in space and time. ... The subject of logic has certainly completely changed its nature and possibilities with G\u00f6del's achievement.\" \u2014[[John von Neumann]]<ref>Halmos, P.R. \"The Legend of von Neumann\", The American Mathematical Monthly, Vol. 80, No. 4. (April 1973), pp. 382\u2013394</ref>\n|}\n\nIn 1931 and while still in Vienna, G\u00f6del published his [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorems]] in ''\u00dcber formal unentscheidbare S\u00e4tze der \"Principia Mathematica\" und verwandter Systeme'' (called in English \"[[On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems|On Formally Undecidable Propositions of \"''Principia Mathematica''\" and Related Systems]]\"). In that article, he proved for any [[Recursion theory|computable]] [[axiomatic system]] that is powerful enough to describe the arithmetic of the [[natural numbers]] (e.g., the [[Peano axioms]] or [[ZFC|Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice]]), that:\n# If the [[formal system|system]] is [[consistency proof|consistent]], it cannot be [[Completeness (logic)|complete]].\n# The consistency of the [[axiom]]s cannot be proved within the [[Axiomatic system|system]].\nThese theorems ended a half-century of attempts, beginning with the work of [[Frege]] and culminating in ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' and [[philosophy of mathematics#Formalism|Hilbert's formalism]], to find a set of axioms sufficient for all mathematics.\n\nIn hindsight, the basic idea at the heart of the incompleteness theorem is rather simple. G\u00f6del essentially constructed a formula that claims that it is unprovable in a given formal system. If it were provable, it would be false, which contradicts the idea that in a consistent system, provable statements are always true.\nThus there will always be at least one true but unprovable statement.\nThat is, for any [[computably enumerable]] set of axioms for arithmetic (that is, a set that can in principle be printed out by an idealized computer with unlimited resources), there is a formula that is true of arithmetic, but which is not provable in that system.\nTo make this precise, however, G\u00f6del needed to produce a method to encode (as natural numbers) statements, proofs, and the concept of provability; he did this using a process known as [[G\u00f6del number]]ing.\n\nIn his two-page paper ''Zum intuitionistischen Aussagenkalk\u00fcl'' (1932) G\u00f6del refuted the finite-valuedness of [[intuitionistic logic]]. In the proof he implicitly used what has later become known as [[intermediate logic|G\u00f6del\u2013Dummett intermediate logic]] (or [[t-norm fuzzy logic|G\u00f6del fuzzy logic]]).\n\n===The mid-1930s: further work and visits to the US===\nG\u00f6del earned his [[habilitation]] at Vienna in 1932, and in 1933 he became a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' (unpaid lecturer) there. In 1933 [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in Germany, and over the following years the Nazis rose in influence in Austria, and among Vienna's mathematicians.\nIn June 1936, [[Moritz Schlick]], whose seminar had aroused G\u00f6del's interest in logic, was assassinated by one of his former students, [[Johann Nelb\u00f6ck]].  This triggered \"a severe nervous crisis\" in G\u00f6del.<ref name=Casti2001>{{Cite book\n | last1 = Casti | first1 = John L.\n | last2 = Depauli | first2 = Werner\n | year = 2001\n | title = G\u00f6del : a life of logic\n | doi = 10.1287/moor.1050.0169\n | isbn = 0-7382-0518-4\n | location = Cambridge, Mass.\n | publisher=Basic Books\n | journal=Mathematics of Operations Research\n | volume = 31\n | page = 147\n | last3 = Koppe\n | first3 = Matthias\n | last4 = Weismantel\n | first4 = Robert\n | postscript = <!--None-->\n}}. From p. 80, which quotes Rudolf G\u00f6del, Kurt's brother and a medical doctor. The words \"a severe nervous crisis\", and the judgement that the Schlick assassination was its trigger, are from the Rudolf G\u00f6del quote. Rudolf knew Kurt well in those years.</ref>\nHe developed paranoid symptoms, including a fear of being poisoned, and spent several months in a sanitarium for nervous diseases.<ref>Dawson 1997, pp. 110\u2013112</ref>\n\nIn 1933, G\u00f6del first traveled to the U.S., where he met [[Albert Einstein]], who became a good friend.<ref>''[[Hutchinson Encyclopedia]]'' (1988), p. 518</ref> He delivered an address to the annual meeting of the [[American Mathematical Society]]. During this year, G\u00f6del also developed the ideas of computability and [[Computable function|recursive functions]] to the point where he was able to present a lecture on general recursive functions and the concept of truth. This work was developed in number theory, using [[G\u00f6del numbering]].\n\nIn 1934 G\u00f6del gave a series of lectures at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] (IAS) in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], New Jersey, entitled ''On undecidable propositions of formal mathematical systems''. [[Stephen Kleene]], who had just completed his PhD at Princeton, took notes of these lectures that have been subsequently published.\n\nG\u00f6del visited the IAS again in the autumn of 1935. The traveling and the hard work had exhausted him, and the next year he took a break to recover from a depressive episode. He returned to teaching in 1937. During this time, he worked on the proof of consistency of the [[axiom of choice]] and of the [[continuum hypothesis]]; he went on to show that these hypotheses cannot be disproved from the common system of axioms of set theory.\n\nHe married Adele Nimbursky (n\u00e9e Porkert, 1899\u20131981), whom he had known for over 10 years, on September 20, 1938.\nTheir relationship had been opposed by his parents on the grounds that she was a divorced dancer, six years older than he was.\n\nSubsequently, he left for another visit to the USA, spending the autumn of 1938 at the IAS and the spring of 1939 at the [[University of Notre Dame]].\n\n===Relocation to Princeton, Einstein and U.S. citizenship===\nAfter the [[Anschluss]] on 12 March 1938, Austria had become a part of [[Nazi Germany]].\nGermany abolished the title ''[[Privatdozent]]'', so G\u00f6del had to apply for a different position under the new order. His former association with Jewish members of the Vienna Circle, especially with Hahn, weighed against him. The University of Vienna turned his application down.\n\nHis predicament intensified when the German army found him fit for conscription. World War II started in September 1939.\nBefore the year was up, G\u00f6del and his wife left Vienna for [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]]. To avoid the difficulty of an Atlantic crossing, the G\u00f6dels took the [[trans-Siberian railway]] to the Pacific, sailed from Japan to San Francisco (which they reached on March 4, 1940), then crossed the U.S. by train to Princeton. There G\u00f6del accepted a position at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] (IAS), which he had previously visited during 1933-34. <ref> IAC biography. https://www.ias.edu/scholars/godel </ref>\n\nG\u00f6del very quickly resumed his mathematical work. In 1940, he published his work ''Consistency of the axiom of choice and of the generalized continuum-hypothesis with the axioms of set theory'', which is a classic of modern mathematics.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} In that work he introduced the [[constructible universe]], a model of [[set theory]] in which the only sets that exist are those that can be constructed from simpler sets. G\u00f6del showed that both the [[axiom of choice]] (AC) and the [[generalized continuum hypothesis]] (GCH) are true in the constructible universe, and therefore must be consistent with the [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel axioms]] for set theory (ZF). This result has had considerable consequences for working mathematicians, as it means that they can assume the axiom of choice when proving the [[Hahn-Banach theorem]]. [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] later constructed a [[structure (mathematical logic)|model]] of ZF in which AC and GCH are false; together these proofs mean that AC and GCH are independent of the ZF axioms for set theory.\n\n[[Albert Einstein]] was also living at Princeton during this time. G\u00f6del and Einstein developed a strong friendship, and were known to take long walks together to and from the Institute for Advanced Study. The nature of their conversations was a mystery to the other Institute members. Economist [[Oskar Morgenstern]] recounts that toward the end of his life Einstein confided that his \"own work no longer meant much, that he came to the Institute merely ... to have the privilege of walking home with G\u00f6del\".<ref>Goldstein (2005), p.&nbsp;33.</ref>\n\nG\u00f6del and his wife, Adele, spent the summer of 1942 in [[Blue Hill, Maine]], at the Blue Hill Inn at the top of the bay. G\u00f6del was not merely vacationing but had a very productive summer of work. Using ''Heft'' 15 [volume 15] of G\u00f6del's still-unpublished ''Arbeitshefte'' [working notebooks], [[John W. Dawson, Jr.]] conjectures that G\u00f6del discovered a proof for the independence of the axiom of choice from finite type theory, a weakened form of set theory, while in Blue Hill in 1942. G\u00f6del's close friend Hao Wang supports this conjecture, noting that G\u00f6del's Blue Hill notebooks contain his most extensive treatment of the problem.\n\nOn December 5, 1947, Einstein and Morgenstern accompanied G\u00f6del to his [[U.S. citizenship]] exam, where they acted as witnesses. G\u00f6del had confided in them that he had discovered an inconsistency in the [[U.S. Constitution]] that could allow the U.S. to become a dictatorship. Einstein and Morgenstern were concerned that their friend's unpredictable behavior might jeopardize his application. Fortunately, the judge turned out to be [[Phillip Forman]], who knew Einstein and had administered the oath at Einstein's own citizenship hearing. Everything went smoothly until Forman happened to ask G\u00f6del if he thought a dictatorship like the [[Nazi regime]] could happen in the U.S. G\u00f6del then started to explain his discovery to Forman. Forman understood what was going on, cut G\u00f6del off, and moved the hearing on to other questions and a routine conclusion.<ref>Dawson 1997, pp. 179\u2013180. The story of G\u00f6del's citizenship hearing is repeated in many versions. Dawson's account is the most carefully researched, but was written before the rediscovery of Morgenstern's written account. Most other accounts appear to be based on Dawson, hearsay or speculation.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://robert.accettura.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Morgenstern_onGoedelcitizenship.pdf |title=History of the Naturalization of Kurt G\u00f6del |date=September 13, 1971 |format=PDF |author=Oskar Morgenstern |accessdate=June 14, 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226210511/https://robert.accettura.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Morgenstern_onGoedelcitizenship.pdf |archivedate=December 26, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nG\u00f6del became a permanent member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton in 1946.

G\u00f6del filled it out in pencil and wrote a cover letter, but he never returned it. \"Theistic\" is italicized in both Wang 1987 and Wang 1996. It is possible that this italicization is Wang's and not G\u00f6del's. The quote follows Wang 1987, with two corrections taken from Wang 1996. Wang 1987 reads \"Baptist Lutheran\" where Wang 1996 has \"baptized Lutheran\". Wang 1987 has \"rel. cong.\", which in Wang 1996 is expanded to \"religious congregation\".</ref>  Describing religion(s) in general, G\u00f6del said: \"Religions are, for the most part, bad\u2014but religion is not\".<ref>Wang 1996 p. 316</ref> According to his wife Adele, \"G\u00f6del, although he did not go to church, was religious and read the Bible in bed every Sunday morning\",<ref>Wang 1996, p. 51.</ref> while of Islam, he said, \"I like Islam: it is a consistent [or consequential] idea of religion and open-minded\".<ref>Wang 1996, p. 148 , 4.4.3. It is one of G\u00f6del's observations, made between\n16 November and 7 December 1975, which Wang found hard to classify under the main topics considered elsewhere in the book.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nThe [[Kurt G\u00f6del Society]], founded in 1987, was named in his honor. It is an international organization for the promotion of research in the areas of logic, philosophy, and the [[history of mathematics]].  The [[University of Vienna]] hosts the Kurt G\u00f6del Research Center for Mathematical Logic. The [[Association for Symbolic Logic]] has invited an annual Kurt G\u00f6del lecturer each year since 1990.\n\nFive volumes of G\u00f6del's collected works have been published. The first two include G\u00f6del's publications; the third includes unpublished manuscripts from G\u00f6del's ''Nachlass'', and the final two include correspondence.\n\nA biography of G\u00f6del was published by [[John W. Dawson, Jr|John Dawson]] in 2005: ''Logical Dilemmas: The Life and Work of Kurt G\u00f6del'' ([[A. K. Peters]], Wellesley, MA, ISBN 1-56881-256-6). G\u00f6del was also one of four mathematicians examined in the 2008 [[BBC]] documentary entitled ''Dangerous Knowledge'' by [[David Malone (independent filmmaker)|David Malone]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/dangerous-knowledge.shtml|title=Dangerous Knowledge|publisher=BBC  |date=June 11, 2008|accessdate=October 6, 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[Douglas Hofstadter]] wrote a popular book in 1979 called ''[[G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach]]'' to celebrate the work and ideas of G\u00f6del, along with those of artist [[M. C. Escher]] and composer [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. The book partly explores the ramifications of the fact that G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem can be applied to any [[Turing-complete]] computational system, which may include the [[human brain]].\n\nG\u00f6del is the main character of [[Daniel Kehlmann]]'s play ''Ghosts in Princeton'' (2011).\n\nThe character Basyli in Quentin Canterel's \"The Jolly Coroner\" (2015) is largely based on G\u00f6del.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Important publications===\nIn German:\n*1930, \"Die Vollst\u00e4ndigkeit der Axiome des logischen Funktionenkalk\u00fcls.\" ''Monatshefte f\u00fcr Mathematik und Physik'' '''37''': 349\u201360.\n*1931, \"\u00dcber formal unentscheidbare S\u00e4tze der ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' und verwandter Systeme, I.\" ''Monatshefte f\u00fcr Mathematik und Physik'' '''38''': 173\u201398.\n*1932, \"Zum intuitionistischen Aussagenkalk\u00fcl\", ''Anzeiger Akademie der Wissenschaften Wien'' '''69''': 65\u201366.\n\nIn English:\n*1940.
