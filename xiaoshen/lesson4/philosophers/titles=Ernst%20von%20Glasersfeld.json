He was a member of the Board of Trustees, [[American Society of Cybernetics]], from which he received the [[McCulloch Memorial Award]] in 1991. He was a member of the Scientific Board, [[Instituto Piaget]], [[Lisbon]].\n\nVon Glasersfeld coined the term [[radical constructivism]] and spent large parts of his life in [[Ireland]] (1940s), in [[Italy]] (1950s) where he worked with [[Silvio Ceccato]], and in the [[United States|US]]. Elaborating upon [[Giambattista Vico]], [[Jean Piaget]]'s genetic [[epistemology]], [[Bishop Berkeley]]'s theory of perception, [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', and other important texts, von Glasersfeld developed his model of [[Constructivist epistemology#Radical constructivism|Radical Constructivism]], which is an [[ethos]] shared by all of these writers to one degree or another.\n\nErnst von Glasersfeld\u2019s literary estate is administered and curated at the Ernst-von-Glasersfeld-Archive at the University of Innsbruck.\n\n==Honors and awards==\n* 1991: Warren McCulloch Memorial Award of the [[American Society for Cybernetics]]\n* 1997: [[Honorary doctorate]] of the [[University of Klagenfurt]]\n* 2002: Reconnaissance du M\u00e9rite scientifique of the [[University of Quebec]]\n* 2005: The Wiener Gold Medal of the American Society for Cybernetics\n* 2005: Gregory Bateson-award of the [[Heidelberg Institute for Systemic Research e.V.]]\n* 2007: Journal of constructivist foundations honoured him on his 90th birthday with a [[Festschrift]] Glasersfeld\n* 2007: [[Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art]], 1st class<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/VHG/XXIV/AB/AB_10542/imfname_251156.pdf | title = Reply to a parliamentary question | language = German | page=1825 | trans_title = | format = pdf | accessdate = 8 January 2013 }}</ref>\n* 2008: Honorary doctorate of the [[University of Innsbruck]]\n* 2009: Honorary Medal of the City of Vienna in gold\n\n== Selected publications==\n[[File:Ernst-von-Glasersfeld 2008 3-fach.jpg|thumb|upright=2|Vienna, 2008, photograph by [[Christian Michelides]]]]\n*Glasersfeld, E. von, (2001) The radical constructivist view of science.
