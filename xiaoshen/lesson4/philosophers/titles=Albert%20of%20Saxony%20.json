Otherwise, his reign as king was largely uneventful.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Military career===\nAlbert's education, as usual with German princes, concentrated to a great extent on [[military]] matters, but he attended lectures at the [[University of Bonn]]. His first experience of warfare came in 1849, when he served as a captain in the [[First War of Schleswig]] against [[Denmark]].\n\nWhen the [[Austro-Prussian War]] broke out in 1866, Albert then [[Crown Prince]] (German: ''Kronprinz''), took up the command of the Saxon forces opposing the [[Prussian Army]] of [[Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia (1828\u20131885)|Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia]]. No attempt was made to defend Saxony; the Saxons fell back into [[Bohemia]] and effected a junction with the [[Austrian Empire|Austrians]]. They took a prominent part in the battles by which the Prussians forced the line of the [[Jizera River|Jizera]] and in the [[Battle of Ji\u010d\u00edn]]. The Crown Prince, however, succeeded in effecting the retreat in good order, and in the decisive [[Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz]] (3 July 1866) he held the extreme left of the Austrian position. The Saxons maintained their post with great tenacity, but were involved in the disastrous defeat of their allies.\n\nDuring these operations the Crown Prince won the reputation of a thorough soldier; after peace was made and Saxony had entered the [[North German Confederation]], he gained the command of the Saxon army, which had now become the XII army corps of the North German army, and in this position carried out the necessary re-organisation. He proved a firm adherent of the Prussian alliance. On the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870 he again commanded the Saxons, who were included in the 2nd army under Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia, his old opponent. At the [[Battle of Gravelotte]], they formed the extreme left of the German army, and with the Prussian Guard carried out the attack on [[Saint-Privat-la-Montagne|St Privat]], the final and decisive action in the battle.\n\nIn the re-organisation of the army which accompanied the march towards Paris the Crown Prince gained a separate command over the 4th army (Army of the Meuse) consisting of the Saxons, the Prussian Guard corps, and the IV ([[Province of Saxony|Prussian Saxony]]) corps. He was succeeded in command of the XII corps by his brother [[George of Saxony|Prince George]], who had served under him in Bohemia.\n\nAlbert took a leading part in the operations which preceded the battle of [[Sedan, France|Sedan]], the 4th army being the pivot on which the whole army wheeled round in pursuit of [[Patrice de MacMahon, Duke of Magenta|Mac-Mahon]]; and the actions of Buzancy and [[Battle of Beaumont|Beaumont]] on 29 and 30 August 1870 were fought under his direction; in the [[Battle of Sedan]] itself (1 September 1870), with the troops under his orders, Albert carried out the envelopment of the French on the east and north.\n\nAlbert's conduct in these engagements won for him the complete confidence of the army, and during the [[Siege of Paris (1870-1871)|Siege of Paris]] his troops formed the north-east section of the investing force. After the conclusion of the [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)]], he was left in command of the German army of occupation, a position which he held till the fall of the [[Paris Commune]]. On the conclusion of peace he was made an inspector-general of the army and a [[field marshal]].\n\n===King===\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Sibyllenort Schloss.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Castle Sibyllenort, were King Albert died.]] -->\n\nOn the death of his father King John on 29 October 1873, the Crown Prince succeeded to the throne as King Albert. His reign proved uneventful, and he took little public part in politics, devoting himself to military affairs, in which his advice and experience were of the greatest value, not only to the Saxon corps but to the German army in general.  During his reign, the Saxon monarchy became constitutional.\n\nIn the 1870s Albert initiated the construction of a Dresden suburb, the [[Albertstadt]]. At that time it was the largest garrison in Germany. Near the former suburb other buildings and places still bear his name: the [[Albertbr\u00fccke]], the [[Alberthafen]], the [[Albertplatz]] and the [[Albertinum]].\n\nIn 1879 he initiated the re-construction of the [[S\u00e4chsisches Landesgymnasium Sankt Afra zu Mei\u00dfen|Saint Afra School]] in [[Meissen]]. In 1897 he was appointed arbitrator between the claimants for the [[Principality of Lippe]].\n\n===Marriage and succession===\nIn [[Dresden]] on 18 June 1853 Albert married Princess [[Carola of Vasa|Carola]], daughter of [[Gustav, Prince of Vasa]] and granddaughter of [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden|Gustav IV Adolf]], the second to last king of [[Sweden]] of the [[House of Holstein-Gottorp (Swedish line)|House of Holstein-Gottorp]]. The marriage was childless.\n\nAlbert died at [[Sibyllenort]] on 19 June 1902, and was succeeded by his brother, who became King [[George, King of Saxony|George]]. He was buried in Dresden on 23 June, among the mourners present were both the German Emperor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] and the Austrian Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]].<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Latest intelligence - Funeral of the King of Saxony |day_of_week=Tuesday |date=24 June 1902 |page_number=5 |issue=36802| }}</ref>\n\n==Ancestors==\n{{ahnentafel top|width=100%}}\n<center>{{ahnentafel-compact5\n|style=font-size: 90%; line-height: 110%;\n|border=1\n|boxstyle=padding-top: 0; padding-bottom: 0;\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.
