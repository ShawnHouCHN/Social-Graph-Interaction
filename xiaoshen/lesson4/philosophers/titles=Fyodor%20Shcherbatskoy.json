Th. Stcherbatsky''', was a [[Russia]]n [[Indologist]] who, in large part, was responsible for laying the foundations in the Western world for the scholarly study of [[Buddhism]] and [[Buddhist philosophy]]. He was born in [[Kielce]], [[Poland]] ([[Russian Empire]]), and died at the Borovoye Resort<ref>The Borovoye / Borovoe / Burabay Resort area is located about 15 miles north-northeast of the railroad town [[Shuchinsk]] ( Shch\u016bch\u012bnsk ) ([[Burabay District]], [[Akmola Province]]) in the northern part of modern-day [[Kazakhstan]].</ref> in northern [[Kazakhstan]].\n\nStcherbatsky studied in the famous [[Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum]] (graduating in 1884), and later in the Historico-Philological Faculty of [[Saint Petersburg State University|Saint Petersburg University]] (graduating in 1889), where [[Ivan Minayeff]] and [[Serge Oldenburg]] were his teachers. Subsequently sent abroad, he studied Indian poetry with [[Georg B\u00fchler]] in Vienna, and Buddhist philosophy with [[Hermann Jacobi]] in [[Bonn]]. In 1897, he and Oldenburg inaugurated ''Bibliotheca Buddhica'', a library of rare Buddhist texts.\n\nReturning from a trip to [[India]] and [[Mongolia]], in 1903 Stcherbatsky published (in Russian) the first volume of ''Theory of Knowledge and Logic of the Doctrine of Later Buddhists''<ref>''Teoriia poznaniia i logika po ucheniiu pozdnie\u012dshikh' buddistov'' ( 2 vols., S.-Petersburg: Tip. \"Gerol'd\", 1903-1909 ) - Vol. I: ''Uchebnik logiki Darmakirti s tolkovaniem na nego Darmottary'' ( 1903 ) ( Note: Vol. 1 includes a translation of Dharmakirti's ''Ny\u0101yabindu'' and Dharmottara's ''Ny\u0101yabindut\u012bk\u0101''. ) - Vol. II: ''Uchenie o vospri\u012d a ti\u012d i umozakli u cheni\u012d'' ( 1909 ).</ref> ( 2 vols., St. Petersburg, 1903-1909 ). In 1928 he established the Institute of Buddhist Culture in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]]. His ''The Conception of Buddhist [[Nirvana]]'' (Leningrad, 1927), written in [[English-language|English]], caused a sensation in the West. He followed suit with his main work in English, ''Buddhist Logic'' (2 vols., 1930\u201332), which has exerted an immense influence on [[Buddhology]].\n\nAlthough Stcherbatsky remained less well known in his own country, his extraordinary fluency in [[Sanskrit]] and [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan languages]] won him the admiration of [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. According to [[Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya]],<ref>Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya ( Nov. 19, 1918 - May 8, 1993 ) - Indian Marxist philosopher. This quote appears to be from the \"Introduction\" Chattopadhyaya wrote to ''Papers of Th. Stcherbatsky'' (1969)(Calcutta: Indian Studies, Past & Present - Soviet Indology Series, No.2).</ref> \"Stcherbatsky did help us \u2013 the Indians \u2013 to discover our own past and to restore the right perspective of our own philosophical heritage.\" The [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] (2004 edition) acclaimed Stcherbatsky as \"the foremost Western authority on Buddhist philosophy\".\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Bapat, P.
