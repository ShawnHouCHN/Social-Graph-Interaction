He is a Visiting Professor in the [[London School of Economics]], [[University of London]], and an associate member of the [[Centre de Recherche en Epist\u00e9mologie Appliqu\u00e9e]] (CREA), [[\u00c9cole Polytechnique]], [[Paris]]. He has held professorial rank positions in [[King's College London]], University of London and in the [[American University of Beirut]], [[Lebanon]]. From 1980 till 2001 he worked for [[UNESCO]], [[Paris]].\n\n== Contribution ==\nDavid Makinson is highly regarded for his work on [[belief revision]], [[Inference#Inference and uncertainty|uncertain reasoning]], and [[modal logic]]. While studying in [[Oxford University]] ([[Worcester College]]) for his [[Doctor of Philosophy|D.Phil]] under the supervision of [[Michael Dummett]], he identified the [[preface paradox]]. In belief revision he created the [[Belief revision#The AGM postulates|AGM account of theory change]] with [[Carlos Alchourr\u00f3n]] and [[Peter G\u00e4rdenfors]]. In modal logic and other [[non-classical logic]]s, he showed how to establish [[completeness (logic)|completeness]] results by adapting the method of [[maximal consistent set]]. In 1969 Makinson discovered the first simple and natural [[propositional logic]] lacking the [[Kripke semantics#Finite model property|finite model property]]. Together with [[Leon van der Torre]] he developed [[input/output logic]].\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://david.c.makinson.googlepages.com David Makinson's website]\n* [http://www.crea.polytechnique.fr/ CREA],  \u00c9cole Polytechnique, Paris\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Makinson, David}}\n[[Category:Australian logicians]]\n[[Category:Academics of King's College London]]\n[[Category:Australian scientists]]\n[[Category:Australian mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Australian libertarians]]\n[[Category:Belief revision]]\n[[Category:1941 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People educated at North Sydney Boys High School]]\n[[Category:Australian philosophers]]\n[[Category:British libertarians]]"}]}}}}
