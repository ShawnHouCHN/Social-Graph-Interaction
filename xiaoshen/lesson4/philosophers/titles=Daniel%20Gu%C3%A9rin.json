He is also known for his opposition to [[Nazism]], [[fascism]] and [[colonialism]], in addition to his support for the [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT) during the [[Spanish Civil War]], and his revolutionary defence of [[free love]] and [[homosexuality]] (see [[Anarchism and LGBT rights]]).\n\n==CGT, PSOP, and Libertarian Marxism==\n{{Libertarian socialism}}\nGu\u00e9rin was born in a liberal Parisian family.<ref name=\"Marshall2005\">{{cite book|author=Bill Marshall|title=France and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History : a Multidisciplinary Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jfq5Tp0nq98C&pg=PA541|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-411-0|pages=541\u2013}}</ref> Early on, he started political activism in the [[anarcho-syndicalism|revolutionary syndicalist]] magazine ''La R\u00e9volution prol\u00e9tarienne'' of [[Pierre Monatte]]. He abandoned university and a literary career in 1926, traveling to [[Lebanon]] (1927\u20131929) and [[French Indochina]] (1929\u20131930) and became a passionate opponent of colonial ventures.<ref name=\"Marshall2005\"/> In 1932, he joined the ''[[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Travail]]'', a syndicalist [[trade union]]; in the mid-1930s, he entered [[Marceau Pivert]]'s movement ''Gauche R\u00e9volutionnaire'' (\"Revolutionary Left\"), a current of the [[SFIO Party]]. When the ''Gauche'' was excluded from the SFIO, he became one of the leaders of the new ''[[Workers and Peasants Socialist Party|Parti Socialiste Ouvrier et Paysan]]'' (PSOP - \"Workers and Peasants Socialist Party\"), and was at that time quite close to [[Leon Trotsky]].\n\nIn 1933, he traveled to [[Nazi Germany]], an experience which inspired him to author ''[[Fascism and Big Business]]'', in which he detailed the roots of Nazi ideology and its ties to [[capitalism]]. Gradually, his [[ethos]] edged further left, eventually developing into a combination of [[Marxism]] and [[anarchism]]. In his essay ''Libertarian Marxism?'', he stated a belief that [[Karl Marx]]'s philosophy should be judged complete at the [[Paris Commune]], in which he appended his original plans for a two-step revolution, first abolishing [[Social class|class]], then abolishing [[government]], into a more immediate, [[Libertarian socialism|libertarian]] process. A brief summary of his ideas can be found in his own words:\n\n: \"''To call oneself a libertarian marxist today is not to look backwards but to be committed to the future. The libertarian marxist is not an [[academic]] but a [[militant]]. He is well aware that it is up to him to change the world - no more, no less. History throws him on the brink.  Everywhere the hour of the socialist revolution has sounded. Revolution - like landing on the moon - has entered the realm of the immediate and possible. Precise definition of the forms of a socialist society is no longer a [[utopia]]n scheme. The only utopians are those who close their eyes to these realities.''\" (''Why Libertarian Marxism, 1969'')\n\n==Spanish Civil War and the 1940s==\nWhen the [[Spanish Civil War]] broke out in 1936, he was quick to support the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] side but within a year, after internal rifts in the Republican armed forces erupted into actual combat \u2014 the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] [[Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia]] on one side, and the [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] [[Workers' Party of Marxist Unification]] (POUM) [the POUM was friendly toward Trotsky but he did not support it, and it is incorrect to call the POUM a Trotskyist party] and anarchist CNT on the other, he had lost a great deal of faith in the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-supported factions.\n\nIn 1946, Gu\u00e9rin went to the United States, and was appalled at the treatment of [[African Americans]], and their lack of [[social equality|equality]] with their [[White people|White]] counterparts.  He witnessed the [[Civil Rights Movement]], and chronicled his experience in his book ''[[Negroes On the March]]'', an important text in the doctrine of [[revolutionary integrationism]], which argues that the struggle for equality by African Americans in the U.S. is their primary struggle, that it can be won only via the struggle by the entire [[working class]] for [[socialism]], and that it is essential to that larger struggle. The same year he published his in-depth study of the [[French Revolution]], ''La lutte de classes sous la premi\u00e8re R\u00e9publique : Bourgeois et 'bras nus' (1793-1797)'' (\"Class struggle in the [[First Republic (France)|First Republic]]: [[Bourgeoisie]] and the people\") in which, unlike many [[leftist]] historians, he was very critical of the [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]].\n\n==Later life==\nIn 1959, by publishing ''Youth of Libertarian Socialism'' he began his involvement with anarchism. Gu\u00e9rin belonged to several [[Anarchist communism|anarchist-communist]] organizations: the ORA (Anarchist Revolutionary Organization), from 1971 to 1977, the UTCL (Union of the Libertarian Communist Workers), from 1979 to his death in 1988 (in 1991, the UTCL became [[Alternative libertaire]]).\n\nHe also participated in the events of [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] in [[Paris]], as well as his calls for [[Algeria]]n independence from France. Gu\u00e9rin's writings were prolific in France, but English translations are rare. Gu\u00e9rin was the subject of the French film ''Daniel Gu\u00e9rin, Combats Dans le Si\u00e8cle (1904-1988)'', made by [[Patrice Spadoni]] and [[Laurent Mulheisen]]. In 1969 Guerin published an essay called \"Libertarian Marxism?\" in which he dealt with the debate between Karl Marx and [[Mikhail Bakunin]] at the [[First International]] and afterwards he suggested that \"Libertarian marxism rejects determinism and fatalism, giving the greater place to individual will, intuition, imagination, reflex speeds, and to the deep instincts of the masses, which are more far-seeing in hours of crisis than the reasonings of the \u2018elites\u2019; libertarian marxism thinks of the effects of surprise, provocation and boldness, refuses to be cluttered and paralysed by a heavy \u2018scientific\u2019 apparatus, doesn\u2019t equivocate or bluff, and guards itself from adventurism as much as from fear of the unknown.\"<ref>[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Daniel_Guerin__Libertarian_Marxism_.html Libertarian Marxism? by [[Daniel Guerin]]]</ref>\n\n==LGBTI activism==\nThe writings of the French [[bisexual]] anarchist Daniel Gu\u00e9rin offer an insight into the tension sexual minorities among the Left have often felt. He was a leading figure in the French Left from the 1930s until his death in 1988. He contributed to the homophile journal ''Arcadie''.<ref name=\"Marshall2005\"/>  In 1954, Gu\u00e9rin was widely attacked for his study of the [[Kinsey Reports]] in which he also detailed the oppression of homosexuals in France. \"The harshest [criticisms] came from Marxists, who tend seriously to underestimate the form of oppression which is antisexual terrorism. I expected it, of course, and I knew that in publishing my book I was running the risk of being attacked by those to whom I feel closest on a political level.\"<ref>Letter of 27 May 1955, Fonds Gu\u00e9rin, BDIC, F\u00b0 \u0394 721/carton 12/4, quoted in Chaperon, \u2018Le fonds Daniel Gu\u00e9rin et l\u2019histoire de la sexualit\u00e9\u2019 in Journal de la BDIC, no.5 (June 2002), p.10</ref> After [[coming out]] in 1965, Gu\u00e9rin was abandoned by the Left, and his papers on sexual liberation were censored or refused publication in left-wing journals.<ref>Berry, David. 2003.

Decades later, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Martel described Gu\u00e9rin as the \"grandfather of the French homosexual movement.\"<ref>Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Martel, ''Le rose et le noir.

(''\u00e0 confesse'', Interview with G\u00e9rard Ponthieu in Sexpol no. 1 (20 January 1975), pp.10-14.)<br />* Together, Gu\u00e9rin argued, such groups bore a great deal of responsibility for fostering homophobic attitudes among the working class as late as the 1970s. Their attitude was \"the most blinkered, the most reactionary, the most antiscientific\".
