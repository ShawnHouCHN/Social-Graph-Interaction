He developed philosophical theory called ''[[reism]]'' ({{lang-pl|reizm}}) and an [[ethical system]] called independent ethics. Kotarbi\u0144ski also contributed significantly to the development of [[praxeology]].\n\n{{ill|pl|Henryk Greniewski}} and {{ill|pl|Kazimierz Pasenkiewicz}} have been doctoral students of Kotarbi\u0144ski.\n\n==Life==\nTadeusz Kotarbi\u0144ski was born on 31st March of 1886 in [[Warsaw]], then [[Congress Poland]], [[Russian Empire]], into an artist's family. His father, Mi\u0142osz Kotarbi\u0144ski, was a painter and a composer; his mother, Ewa de domo Koskowska, a pianist. His uncles were - J\u00f3zef Kotarbi\u0144ski, an important figure in Polish theater circles and Wilhelm Kotarbi\u0144ski - a talented painter. Expelled from secondary school in 1905 for participating in a strike, Kotarbi\u0144ski managed to graduate two years later. He studied first as an unenrolled student at [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]], attending mostly lectures on mathematics and physics; then architecture in [[Lvov]] and [[Darmstadt]], to finally settle for studies in philosophy and [[classical philology]] at the [[Lvov University]]. His professors were some of the most esteemed philosophers, logicians and mathematicians of his time: [[Kazimierz Twardowski]], Jan \u0141ukasiewicz, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Witwicki and [[philologist]] Stanis\u0142aw Witkowski. He received his PhD degree with the thesis \"Utilitarianism in the ethics of Mill and Spencer\" in 1912.\n\nAfter graduation he first worked as a secondary school [[classical language]]s teacher at the Rey Gymnasium in [[Warsaw]]. In 1918 Kotarbi\u0144ski started lecturing career in philosophy at the [[Warsaw University]]. In years 1929/1930 he held the position of [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of [[Humanities]] Faculty.\n\n==Philosophy==\n\n===Reism===\n[[Reism]] is a pansomatism (from [[Greek language|Greek]]:\u03c0\u1fb6\u03bd meaning \"all\" and \u03c3\u1ff6\u03bc\u03b1 - \"body\") [[ontology]] as well as semantic theory developed by Kotarbi\u0144ski and most extensively exposed in his major work: ''Elements of the Theory of Knowledge, Formal Logic and Methodology of the Sciences'', first published in 1929. Kotarbi\u0144ski was the creator of the term [[reism]] - a word derived from the [[Latin]] \"res\" meaning \"thing\". \n\n===Ontological reism===\n\nKotarbi\u0144ski's ontological reism approach assumes that the only things that exist, and thus the only [[ontological category]] to be used, are individual, concrete objects (or bodies) in opposition to doctrines allowing for the existence of such categories as universals, states of affairs, properties, relations, sets, classes, mental constructs etc.\n\n===Semantic reism===\nIn its sematic formulation Kotarbi\u0144ski postulated that meaningful sentences have to contain so-called genuine names (referring to concrete objects) as opposed to abstract objects' names or non-genuine names (onomatoids). He also distinguished [[reism|onomatoids]] from empty names, which he considered to be reistic. Sentences with onomatoids only were in his view meaningless, whereas those with empty names meaningful.\n\nReism has been anticipated by philosophers preceding Kotarbi\u0144ski ([[Leibnitz]], [[Brentano]] and his pupils and earlier [[nominalism|nominalists]] and [[materialism|materialists]]), but it was Kotarbi\u0144ski who developed it to the complete, systematic exposition and gave it its name. \n\nIn 1958 in \"Philosophical Studies\" n4 (7) Kotarbi\u0144ski published ''Developmental Stages of Concretism'', an essay in which he discussed the construction and evolution of his theory starting from the early [[concretism]] or [[nominalism]], passing through seven stages of re-elaboration and finally culminating in pansomatism. Kotarbi\u0144ski used terms: reism, pansomatism and [[concretism]] as equivalents to some extent throughout his works.\n\n==Works==\n* ''Elementy teorii poznania, logiki formalnej i metodologii nauk''.
