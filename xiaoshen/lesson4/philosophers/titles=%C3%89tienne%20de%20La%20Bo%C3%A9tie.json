His father was a royal official of the P\u00e9rigord region and his mother was the sister of the president of the [[Bordeaux]] Parlement (assembly of lawyers). Orphaned at an early age, he was brought up by his uncle and namesake, the curate of Bouilbonnas, and received his law degree from the [[University of Orl\u00e9ans]] in 1553. His great and precocious ability earned La Bo\u00e9tie a royal appointment to the Bordeaux Parlement the following year, despite his being under the minimum age. There he pursued a distinguished career as judge and diplomatic negotiator until his untimely death in 1563, at the age of thirty-two. La Bo\u00e9tie was also a distinguished poet and humanist, translating [[Xenophon]] and [[Plutarch]], and being closely connected with the leading young [[La Pl\u00e9iade|Pleiade]] group of poets, including [[Pierre Ronsard]], [[Jean Dorat]], and [[Jean-Antoine de Baif]].\"<ref name=Rothbard/> La Bo\u00e9tie opposed religious toleration, arguing that allowing Protestants and Catholics to both conduct worship services would undermine the crown.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nHe served with [[Montaigne]] in the [[Bordeaux]] ''[[parlement]]'' and is immortalized in Montaigne's [[essay]] on [[friendship]].\n\n==Writings==\nLa Bo\u00e9tie\u2019s writings include a few [[sonnet]]s, translations from the classics, and an essay attacking [[absolute monarchy]] and [[tyranny]] in general, ''[[Discourse on Voluntary Servitude|Discours de la servitude volontaire ou le Contr'un]]'' (''Discourse on Voluntary Servitude, or the Anti-Dictator'').\n\nThe essay asserts that tyrants have power because the people give it to them. [[Liberty]] has been abandoned once by society, which afterward stayed corrupted and prefers the slavery of the [[courtesan]] to the freedom of one who refuses to dominate as he refuses to [[Obedience (human behavior)|obey]]. Thus, La Bo\u00e9tie linked together obedience and domination, a relationship which would be later theorised by latter [[anarchism|anarchist]] thinkers. By advocating a solution of simply refusing to support the tyrant, he became one of the earliest advocates of [[civil disobedience]] and [[nonviolent resistance]]. [[Lew Rockwell]] summarizes La Bo\u00e9tie\u2019s political philosophy as follows:\n\n<blockquote>\nTo him, the great mystery of politics was obedience to rulers. Why in the world do people agree to be looted and otherwise oppressed by government overlords? It is not just fear, Boetie explains in \u201cThe Discourse on Voluntary Servitude,\u201d for our consent is required. And that consent can be non-violently withdrawn.<ref name=Rockwell>[[Lew Rockwell|Rockwell, Lew]] (11 February 2011), http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard78.html], ''[[LewRockwell.com]]''</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIt was once thought, following Montaigne's claims, that La Bo\u00e9tie wrote the essay in 1549 at the age of eighteen, but recent authorities argue that it is \"likely that the ''Discourse'' was written in 1552 or 1553, at the age of twenty-two, while La Bo\u00e9tie was at the university.\"<ref>Rockwell, Lew (11 February 2011), p. 38. n. 2. \"Having remained long in manuscript, the actual date of writing the ''Discourse of Voluntary Servitude'' remains a matter of dispute. It seems clear, however, and has been so accepted by recent authorities, that Montaigne's published story that La Bo\u00e9tie wrote the ''Discourse'' at the age of eighteen or even of sixteen was incorrect. Montaigne's statement, as we shall see further below, was probably part of his later campaign to guard his dead friend's reputation by dissociating him from the revolutionary Huguenots who were claiming La Bo\u00e9tie's pamphlet for their own. Extreme youth tended to cast the ''Discourse'' in the light of a work so youthful that the radical content was hardly to be taken seriously as the views of the author. Internal evidence as well as the erudition expressed in the work make it likely that the ''Discourse'' was written in 1552 or 1553, at the age of twenty-two, while La Bo\u00e9tie was at the university.\" See Paul Bonnefon (1892), pp. 390\u20131; and Donald Frame, ''Montaigne: A Biography'' (New York: Harcourt Brace, & World, 1965), p. 71 (37\u201338 n. 2).</ref> Some Montaigne scholars have argued that the essay was in fact the work of Montaigne himself. The essay was circulated privately and not published until 1576 after La Bo\u00e9tie's death. He died at [[Germignan (France)|Germignan]] near [[Bordeaux]] in 1563. His last days are described in a long letter from Montaigne to his own father.\n\n==Influence==\nIn the twentieth century, many European anarchists began to cite La Bo\u00e9tie as an influence, including [[Gustav Landauer]],\n[[Bart de Ligt]], and [[Simone Weil]].<ref>[[Roland Bleiker]], ''\n''Popular Dissent.
