Doyen and pioneer of [[mathematical logic]] research in [[Bulgaria]] who developed a Bulgarian school in the theory of computability, namely the algebraic (or axiomatic) recursion theory.\n\nSkordev's field of scientific interests include [[recursion theory|computability]] and [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]] in [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], [[mathematical logic]], generalized [[recursion theory]], and theory of [[computer programs|programs]] and [[theory of computation|computation]].\n\nSkordev has more than 45 years of lecturing experience in [[calculus]], [[mathematical logic]], [[logic programming]], [[discrete mathematics]], and [[computer science]].  He authored about 90 scientific publications including two monographs, and was one of the authors of the new Bulgarian [[phonetics|phonetic]] [[keyboard layout#Bulgarian|keyboard layout]] proposed (but rejected) to become a state [[Standardization|standard]] in 2006.\n\n==References==\n* [http://www.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/fmi/logic/skordev/ Dimiter Skordev]\n* [http://www.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/fmi/logic/skordev/history.htm Historical notes on the development of mathematical logic in Sofia]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Skordev, Dimiter}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:20th-century mathematicians]]\n[[Category:21st-century mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Mathematical logicians]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian logicians]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian philosophers]]\n[[Category:People from Sofia]]\n\n\n{{Bulgaria-scientist-stub}}\n{{Europe-mathematician-stub}}"}]}}}}
