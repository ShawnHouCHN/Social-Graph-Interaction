Although he died at only 23 years of age, he was already considered one of \"the greatest mathematicians of the younger generation\" by his professors [[Helmut Hasse]], and [[Richard Courant]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Chevalley |first=Claude |last2=Lautman |first2=Albert |title=Logical Writings |chapter=Biographical Note on Jacques Herbrand |editor-last=Goldfarb |editor-first=Warren D. |editor2-last=Van Heijenoort |editor2-first=Jean |location=Berlin |publisher=Springer |year=1971 |pages=21\u201323 |isbn=90-277-0176-8 }}</ref>\n\nHe worked in [[mathematical logic]] and [[class field theory]]. He introduced [[recursion#Functional recursion|recursive function]]s. ''[[Herbrand's theorem]]'' refers to either of two completely different theorems. One is a result from his doctoral thesis in [[proof theory]], and the other one half of the [[Herbrand\u2013Ribet theorem]]. The [[Herbrand quotient]] is a type of [[Euler characteristic]], used in [[homological algebra]]. He contributed to [[Hilbert's program]] in the foundations of mathematics by providing a constructive consistency proof for a weak system of arithmetic. The proof uses the above-mentioned, proof-theoretic Herbrand's theorem.\n\n==Biography==\nHerbrand finished his doctorate at [[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]] in Paris under [[Ernest Vessiot]] in 1929. He joined the army in October 1929, however, and so did not defend his thesis at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] until the following year. He was awarded a [[Rockefeller Foundation|Rockefeller fellowship]] that enabled him to study in Germany in 1931, first with [[John von Neumann]] in Berlin, then during June with [[Emil Artin]] in Hamburg, and finally with [[Emmy Noether]] in [[G\u00f6ttingen]].\n\nHe submitted his principal study of proof theory and general recursive functions \"On the consistency of arithmetic\" early in 1931. While the essay was under consideration, [[G\u00f6del]]'s \"On formally undecidable sentences of ''Principia Mathematica'' and related systems I\" announced the impossibility of formalizing within a theory that theory's consistency proof. Herbrand studied G\u00f6del's essay and wrote an appendix to his own study explaining why G\u00f6del's result did not contradict his own. In July of that year he was mountain-climbing in the French [[Alps]] with two friends when he fell to his death in the granite mountains of [[Massif des \u00c9crins]]. \"On the consistency of arithmetic\" was published posthumously.\n\n==Quotation==\n''\"Jacques Herbrand would have hated [[Bourbaki]]\"'' said French mathematician [[Claude Chevalley]] quoted in Mich\u00e8le Chouchan, ''\"Nicolas Bourbaki Faits et l\u00e9gendes\"'', \u00c9ditions du choix, 1995.\n\n==Bibliography==\nPrimary literature:\n* 1967.
