Adorno]]. Bloch's work focuses on the thesis that in a [[Humanism|humanistic]] world where [[oppression]] and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] have been eliminated there will always be a truly [[revolutionary]] force.\n\n==Life==\nBloch was born in [[Ludwigshafen]], the son of a [[Jews|Jewish]] railway-employee. After studying philosophy, he married Else von Stritzky, daughter of a Baltic brewer in 1913, who died in 1921. His second marriage with Linda Oppenheimer lasted only a few years. His third wife was [[Karola Bloch|Karola Piotrowska]], a [[Poland|Polish]] [[architect]], whom he married in 1934 in [[Vienna]]. When the Nazis came to power, they had to flee, first into Switzerland, then to Austria, France, Czechoslovakia, and finally the USA. Bloch returned to the [[East Germany|GDR]] in 1949 and obtained a chair in philosophy at [[Leipzig]].\n\n1948 he was offered the chair of philosophy at the [[University of Leipzig]]. In 1955 he was awarded the National Prize of the GDR. In addition, he became a member of the [[German Academy of Sciences at Berlin]] (AdW). He had more or less become the political philosopher of the GDR. Among his many academic students from this period was his assistant Manfred Buhr, who earned his doctorate with him in 1957, and was later professor in [[Greifswald]], then director of the Central Institute of Philosophy of the Academy of Sciences (ADC) in Berlin and who become a critic of Bloch.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nBut the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian uprising in 1956]] brought the convinced Marxist Bloch to reverse course for the SED regime. Because he taught his [[humanism|humanistic]] ideas of freedom, he was retired in 1957 for political reasons \u2013 not because of his age, 72 years. A number of scientists and students spoke publicly against this forced retirement, among them the renowned professor and colleague [[Emil Fuchs (theologian)|Emil Fuchs]] and his students as well as Fuchs's grandson [[:de:Klaus Fuchs-Kittowski|Klaus Fuchs-Kittowski]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nWhen the [[Berlin Wall]] was built in 1961, he did not return to the GDR, but went to [[T\u00fcbingen]] in [[West Germany]], where he received an honorary chair in Philosophy. He died in T\u00fcbingen.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n==Thought==\nBloch's ''[[The Principle of Hope]]'' was written during his emigration in the USA, where he lived briefly in [[New Hampshire]] before settling in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. He wrote the lengthy three volume work in the reading room of Harvard's [[Widener Library]]. Bloch originally planned to publish it there under the title ''Dreams of a Better Life''. ''The Principle of Hope'' tries to provide an encyclopedic account of mankind's and nature's orientation towards a socially and technologically improved future.\n\n==Influence==\n[[File:EndloseTreppeLutherturm.JPG|thumb|right|''[[Endlose Treppe]]'' by [[Max Bill]], which is dedicated to the ''Principle of Hope'' by Bloch.]]\nBloch's work became very influential in the course of the student [[Protests of 1968|protest movements in 1968]] and in [[liberation theology]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} \nIt is cited as a key influence by [[J\u00fcrgen Moltmann]] in his ''Theology of Hope'' (1967, Harper and Row, New York), by [[Dorothee S\u00f6lle]], and by [[Ernesto Balducci]].
