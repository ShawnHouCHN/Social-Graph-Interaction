He was the son of Bernard de Garaby and Fran\u00e7oise de Pierrepont, the sister of Herv\u00e9 de Pierrepont, commander of the city and fortress of [[Granville, Manche|Granville]] for the king. Although diminutive, unattractive and malformed, his keen intelligence, amenities, and the subtleties of his mind, nonetheless made him an attractive character for nature had endowed him with the qualities of mind and heart while denying him physical beauty.\n\nGaraby received his early education at home, under Francis Dyens, to whose memory he dedicated two couplets and a few lines of Latin prose. He then went on to study eloquence at the [[University of Caen]], under Professor [[Antoine Halley]] with whom he was to remain in friendly terms until the end of his life. Amongst his classmates were, the theologian, orator, poet and humanist, Guillaume Marcel and [[Georges de Br\u00e9beuf]], the translator into French of [[Lucan]]'s ''[[Pharsalia]]''.\n\nGraced with a keen taste for [[literature]], he started to compose, soon after finishing his [[classical studies]]. Huet commented him that \"He loved literary men with a passion [and] he made them into his major friends.\"<ref>''\"Il aima passionn\u00e9ment les gens de lettres [et] il en fit ses principaux amis.\"''</ref> Aside from Huet himself, Garaby was acquainted with several scholars of his time, like [[Vincent Voiture|Voiture]], [[Jean Chapelain|Chapelain]] et [[Gilles M\u00e9nage|M\u00e9nage]], [[Jean Fran\u00e7ois Sarrazin|Sarrazin]], [[Jacques Moisant de Brieux|Moisant de Brieux]], [[Jacques de Calli\u00e8res]], [[Nicholas Bourbon (the younger)|Nicolas Bourbon]], [[Pierre Halley]], Jacques Du Chevreuil, etc.\n\nDescribed as \"a kind of Norman [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]]\", Garaby did not apply himself, nor did he determine to become a successful man of letters. Rather than being a career, literature was simply the exercise of the gift of intelligence, the taste and imagination of the gentleman who only sought the pleasures of study for its own sake. Huet concurred: \"He had more genius for letters than achievement. For although he possessed enough Latin, he did not have much use of the ancient writers, and his active mind made composing easier and more pleasant than reading and polishing. Hence one finds more fertility than purity, clarity and elegance in his Latin prose collection of Christian, political and moral sentiments or in his French poetry.\"<ref>''\"Il avait plus de g\u00e9nie pour les lettres que d'acquis. Car encore qu'il poss\u00e9d\u00e2t assez bien la langue latine, il n'avait pas beaucoup d'usage des anciens auteurs, et son esprit actif lui rendait la composition plus agr\u00e9able et facile que la lecture et que le travail de la lime. Aussi ne trouve-t-on pas dans ce recueil d'ouvrages de prose et de po\u00e9sies latines, ni dans ce volume de sentiments chr\u00e9tiens, politiques et moraux, qu'il a publi\u00e9s, ni dans ses vers fran\u00e7ais, tant de puret\u00e9, de nettet\u00e9, ni d'\u00e9l\u00e9gance que de fertilit\u00e9.\"'' in ''Origines de Caen'', p. 428.</ref>\n\nGaraby remained with his father on their property of [[Trois-Monts]], fairly close to Caen, long enough for his former professor to dub it his Parnassus. There he composed his French and Latin poems and his [[satire]]s. Garaby's name is also associated with the foundation, along with [[Samuel Bochart]], [[Pierre-Daniel Huet]] and [[Jean Regnault de Segrais]], of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences, Arts et Belles-Lettres de Caen|Royal Academy of Belles-Lettres of Caen]].\n\nAfter Herv\u00e9 de Pierrepont, Garaby's maternal uncle, died on 18 August 1662, he inherited his property and names, to be called from then on \"Garaby de Pierrepont de La Luzerne \u00c9tienville\". This plenteous bequest made him think of entering into matrimony. By and through Madame de Matignon's benevolent intervention, Garaby soon wedded Anne de Vass\u00e9, of an ancient and noble family in [[Maine (province)|Maine]]. Antoine Halley wrote, on this occasion, a wedding song celebrating the bride's beauty, spirit, and dowry. No children came of this union.\n\nHaving established his home in [[\u00c9tienville]], where he spent the last years of his life. Huet also described Garaby de La Luzerne as \"true and faithful to the duties of friendship, generous and kind, and very good company.\" Upon his death on 4 July 1679 in [[Picauville|L'Isle-Marie]], at the age of sixty-two, he was buried in the middle of the choir of the \u00c9tienville church. One of his descendants, the abb\u00e9 de Garaby, a former professor of philosophy at the College of Saint-Brieuc, and author of several books of philosophy and morality, gave Father Leloup, the cur\u00e9 of \u00c9tienville, a small marble plaque engraved with the following praise of his forebear:\n\n{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center|width=23% |align=center|quote=Dear relative, I did not get to know you down here;<br>\nAs time and place estranged us; <br>\nBut I hope to join and embrace you in heaven, <br>\nOnce I shall be born into eternity.}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Works==\n* {{fr icon}} ''Satires in\u00e9dites'', Ed. & intr.
