In his youth, he and his younger brother [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] were students of [[Zhou Dunyi]], one of the architects of [[Neo-Confucian]] [[cosmology]]. His [[philosophy]] was [[Dualism|dualistic]] (between [[Qi#Philosophical roots|all that is tangible]] and [[Li (Neo-Confucianism)|all that is intangible]]) and [[Pantheism|pantheistic]] (believing that all that is intangible is the same thing, such as [[Tian|god]], the [[Nature (philosophy)#Eastern civilisation and the philosophical question of nature|human nature]], [[Qing (concept)|feelings]], [[Yinyang|actions]] (we see things acting, but not the action itself), movement (likewise), [[Tao#Confucian interpretations|social roles and relations]] (likewise), chance, etc., and that such a unified, universal principle is '''''in''''' everything that is sensible [rather than in [[Analogy of the divided line|an external reality]] as in [[Platonism]]]); among his [[quotation|quotes]] are \"outside ''[[Li (Neo-Confucianism)|dao]]'' there are no [[Qi#Philosophical roots|things]] and outside things there is no ''dao''\", \"we call it god to emphasize the wonderful mystery of principle in ten thousand things, just as we call it lord (''di'') to characterize its being the ruler of events\" and \"in terms of the reality, it is change; in terms of principle, it is ''dao''; in terms of its function, it is god; in terms of its destiny in a human being, it is human nature\".<ref>\"[http://www.iep.utm.edu/chenghao/ Cheng Hao]\" at the [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]</ref>\n\n==Life==\nHao's grandfather was a county magistrate in [[Huangpi]] and died there while in that capacity.  Hao's father Cheng Xiang ({{zh|c=\u7a0b\u73e6}}) was still young at the time and was unable to return to Luoyang, so he was forced to grow up in Huangpi instead. He later became county magistrate ({{zh|s=\u7e23\u5c09|p=xi\u00e0nw\u00e8i}}), at which time his two sons Hao and Yi were born.<ref>[http://www.huangpi.gov.cn/publish/2008-4-7/2008-4-71010640.shtml Huangpi Government Website (Chinese)]</ref>  In 1057 Hao passed the [[Imperial examinations]] and became an entered scholar.  He successively served as an administrative clerk in Hu County, [[Shaanxi]], as an administrative clerk in Shangyuan County (an area now in [[Nanjing]]), as an administrative director in [[Zezhou County|Zezhou]], as well as a minister of ceremony, a Censor, a [[tax]] and [[tariff]] official, a ceremony minister to the military, and various other positions.\n\nCheng Hao and Cheng Yi were among the pioneers of Song Dynasty Neo-Confucianism, and they are often credited with its formal creation along with [[Zhu Xi]] and several other scholars.  The two brothers were sometimes referred to as \"The Two Chengs\" ({{zh|c=\u4e8c\u7a0b}}), or individually as \"Cheng the Elder\" ({{zh|c=\u5927\u7a0b}}) and \"Cheng the Younger\" ({{zh|c=\u5c0f\u7a0b}}).  They dealt extensively with cosmology in their studies, applying Neo-Confucian principles to their studies of [[celestial bodies]].  In particular, the brothers identified and applied the principle of Divine or Natural Order, called ''[[Li (Neo-Confucianism)|li]]'', to that of ''[[Tian]]'', the Heavens, as their original and guiding power.<ref>Cheng Yi wrote: \"The Heavens themselves are ''[[Li (Neo-Confucianism)|li]]''.\" ({{zh|c=\"\u5929\u8005\u7406\u4e5f\"}}).</ref>  Hao established schools at [[Fugou]] and Songyang (in modern [[Dengfeng]]).  Throughout his life he promoted the view that study and scholarship were means to making men [[List of types of spiritual teachers|sages]], once writing: \"The studies of a superior man must arrive at sagacity [sage-hood] and ''then'' upon his own intellect; in the case of not arriving at sage-hood but upon his own intellect, all is lost.\"<ref>{{zh|t=\"\u541b\u5b50\u4e4b\u5b78\uff0c\u5fc5\u81f3\u8056\u4eba\u800c\u5f8c\u5df1\u3002\u4e0d\u81f3\u8056\u4eba\u800c\u81ea\u5df1\u8005\uff0c\u7686\u68c4\u4e5f\u3002\"}}</ref>  Hao died in 1085 at the age of fifty-three.\n\n==Legacy==\n\nHao was known as an outgoing, laid-back, and lively man, in contrast to his stern and severe younger brother.  As Neo-Confucianism's popularity grew throughout the early second millennium AD, the two Cheng brothers along with Zhou Dunyi, [[Zhang Zai]], [[Shao Yong]], and [[Sima Guang]] became known as \"The Six Masters of Northern Song\"<ref>{{zh|c=\u5317\u5b8b\u516d\u5148\u751f}}</ref> for their philosophical contributions.\n\nHao also received several [[Posthumous recognition|posthumous]] titles: in 1220 he was given the [[posthumous name]] \"Lord of Purity\" ({{zh|t=\u7d14\u516c}}) by the emperor.  In 1241 he was given the posthumous title of \"''Bo'' [Earl] of [[Henan]]\".  In 1330, an imperial decree made Hao the posthumous \"Lord of Yu Kingdom [Henan]\".\n\nCheng Hao's offspring held the title of Wujing Boshi (\u4e94\u7ecf\u535a\u58eb; [[w:zh:\u4e94\u7d93\u535a\u58eb|\u4e94\u7d93\u535a\u58eb]]; W\u01d4j\u012bng B\u00f3sh\u00ec).<ref name=\"BrunnertHagelstrom2013\">{{cite book|author1=H.S.
