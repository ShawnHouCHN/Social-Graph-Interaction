He served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher Government]] from 1989 to 1990, and was the [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] from [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979]] to [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001]].\n\nWithin weeks of becoming Prime Minister, Major presided over British participation in the [[Gulf War]] in March 1991 and negotiated the [[Maastricht Treaty]] in December 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1991/dec/11/european-council-maastricht |title=European Council (Maastricht) |work=Hansard |date=11 December 1991 |accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref> He went on to lead the Conservatives to a fourth consecutive election victory, winning the most votes in British electoral history with over 14 million in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 general election]], with a reduced majority in the House of Commons. Shortly after this, even though a staunch supporter of the ERM, the Major Government became responsible for British exit from the [[Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM) after [[Black Wednesday]] on 16 September 1992. This event led to a loss of confidence in Conservative economic policies and Major was never able to achieve a lead in opinion polls again.\n\nDespite the eventual revival of economic growth amongst other successes such as the beginnings of the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], by the mid-1990s the Conservative Party was embroiled in ongoing [[#\"Sleaze\"|sleaze scandals]] involving various MPs, including Cabinet Ministers. Criticism of Major's leadership reached such a pitch that he chose to resign as leader in June 1995, challenging his critics to either back him or challenge him; he was duly challenged by [[John Redwood]] but was easily re-elected. By this time, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had moved to the centre-left under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]] and won a large number of by-elections, eventually depriving the Government of its majority in February 1997. Major went on to lose the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]] months later in one of the largest electoral defeats since the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act]] of 1832.\n\nAfter defeat, Major resigned as Prime Minister and was succeeded as Leader of the Conservative Party by [[William Hague]]. He went on to retire from active politics, leaving the House of Commons at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]]. Major is the oldest living former UK Prime Minister and remains an active speaker and businessman. He was an especially active figure on the side of the [[Britain Stronger in Europe|Remain campaign]] preceding the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|European Union membership referendum, 2016]] that resulted in the United Kingdom voting to leave the [[European Union]].<ref>{{cite news|title=John Major: 'Deceitful, misleading campaign'|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36454782|accessdate=18 July 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=5 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nMajor was born in 1943 at [[St Helier Hospital]] in [[London Borough of Sutton|Sutton]], [[Surrey]], the son of Gwen Major, {{nee}} Coates, and former [[music hall]] performer [[Tom Major-Ball]] who was 64 years old when John was born.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sole.org.uk/johnmajor.htm |title=Ex Prime Minister Sir John Major and his Sewell Ancestors |publisher=Sole.org.uk |accessdate=22 October 2013}}</ref> He was christened John Roy Major but only \"John\" was recorded on his [[birth certificate]].

In 1955, with his father's garden ornaments business in decline, the family moved to [[Brixton]]. The following year, Major watched his first debate in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], where [[Harold Macmillan]] presented his only Budget as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], and has attributed his political ambitions to that event. He also credited a chance meeting with former Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] on the [[King's Road]] shortly afterwards.<ref name=\"number2\"/><ref>{{cite news|title=Harold MacMillan's only budget|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/budget97/background/bud1945_79.shtml|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=1 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nMajor left school at the age of 16 in 1959 with three [[General Certificate of Education|O-levels]] in History, English Language and English Literature. He later gained three more O-levels by [[Distance education|correspondence course]], in the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British Constitution]], Mathematics and Economics.\n\nMajor's first job was as a clerk in the insurance brokerage firm Pratt & Sons in 1959. Disliking this job, he quit. Major joined the [[Young Conservatives (UK)|Young Conservatives]] in Brixton at this time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Young Conservatives|url=http://www.johnmajor.co.uk/page1279.html|work=John Major|accessdate=1 August 2012}}</ref> Major was 19 years old when his father died at the age of 82 on 27 March 1962.

He later decided to undertake a correspondence course in banking. Major took up a post as an executive at the [[Standard Chartered Bank]] in May 1965 and he rose quickly through the ranks. He was sent to work in [[Jos, Nigeria]] by the bank in 1967 and he nearly died in a car accident there.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=35}}<ref>{{cite web|title=John Major car crash in Nigeria |url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/unreported-world/articles/nigeria-reporters-blog |work=Channel 4 News |accessdate=1 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406135514/http://www.channel4.com/programmes/unreported-world/articles/nigeria-reporters-blog |archivedate=6 April 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Early political career==\nMajor was interested in politics from an early age. Encouraged by fellow Conservative Derek Stone, he started giving speeches on a [[soapbox|soap-box]] in [[Brixton Market]]. He stood as a candidate for [[Lambeth London Borough Council]] at the age of 21 in 1964, and was elected in the Conservative landslide in 1968. While on the Council he was Chairman of the Housing Committee, being responsible for overseeing the building of several large [[council housing]] estates. He lost his seat in 1971.<ref name=\"johnmajor8\">{{cite web|title=John Major speeches during 1979 to 1987|url=http://www.johnmajor.co.uk/page8.html|work=John Major}}</ref>\n\nMajor was an active [[Young Conservatives (UK)|Young Conservative]], and according to his biographer [[Anthony Seldon]] brought \"youthful exuberance\" to the Tories in Brixton, but was often in trouble with the professional agent Marion Standing.<ref name=\"johnmajor8\"/> Also according to Seldon, the formative political influence on Major was Jean Kierans, a divorc\u00e9e 13 years his elder, who became his political mentor and his lover, too. Seldon writes \"She&nbsp;... made Major smarten his appearance, groomed him politically, and made him more ambitious and worldly.\" Their relationship lasted from 1963 to sometime after 1968.\n\nMajor stood for election to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] in [[St Pancras North (UK Parliament constituency)|St Pancras North]] in both [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|United Kingdom]] [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|general elections in 1974]], but was unsuccessful each time. In November 1976, Major was selected to be the candidate for the safe Conservative seat of [[Huntingdonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdonshire]]. He won the seat in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]].<ref name=\"johnmajor8\"/> Following boundary changes, Major became the MP for the newly formed seat of [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] in [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983]], and retained the seat in [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987]], [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997]]. He retired from Parliament in [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001]].\n\nHe was appointed as a [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] in 1981, becoming an [[whip (politics)|assistant whip]] in 1983. He was later made [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State|Under-Secretary of State]] for [[Department for Work and Pensions|Social Security]] in 1985, before being promoted to become [[Minister of State]] in the same department in 1986, first attracting national media attention over cold weather payments to the elderly in January 1987, when Britain was in the depths of a severe winter.<ref>{{cite web|last=Deer|first=Brian|title=MINISTERS RIG 'COLD' CASH FOR OLD|url=http://briandeer.com/social/john-major.htm|work=The Sunday Times (London) January 11, 1987|publisher=The Sunday Times (London)|accessdate=3 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite hansard | house=House of Commons | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1987/jan/20/severe-weather-payments|title=Severe Weather Payments | date = 20 January 1987 | column_start = 747 | column_end = 754 }}</ref>\n\n==Cabinet Minister==\nFollowing the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 election]], Major was promoted to the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] as [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]]. Two years later, in a surprise July 1989 reshuffle, Major succeeded [[Geoffrey Howe]] as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]]. The rapid promotion surprised many, due to Major's relative lack of experience in the Cabinet. Just three months later, in October 1989, Major was appointed [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] after the sudden resignation of [[Nigel Lawson]]. This meant that, despite only being in the Cabinet for little over two years, Major had gone from the most junior position in the Cabinet to holding two of the [[Great Offices of State]].\n\nAs Chancellor, Major presented only one Budget, the first to be televised live, in early 1990. He publicised it as ''a budget for savings'' and announced the [[Tax-Exempt Special Savings Account]] (TESSA), arguing that measures were required to address the marked fall in the household [[savings ratio]] that had been apparent during the previous [[Fiscal year|financial year]]. In June 1990, Major suggested that the proposed Single European Currency should be a \"hard currency\", competing against existing national currencies; this idea was not in the end adopted. In October 1990, Major and [[Douglas Hurd]], Major's successor as Foreign Secretary, persuaded Thatcher to support British entry to the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]], a move which she had resisted for many years, and which had played a part in the resignation of Nigel Lawson.<ref>Edmund Dell, ''The Chancellors: A History of the Chancellors of the Exchequer, 1945-90'' (HarperCollins, 1997) pp 541-50.</ref>\n\nAfter [[Michael Heseltine]] [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1990|challenged]] Thatcher for the leadership of the Conservative Party in November 1990, Major and [[Douglas Hurd]] were the proposer and seconder on her nomination papers for the leadership ballot. After Thatcher was unable to win enough support to prevent a second ballot, she announced her resignation as Prime Minister and Conservative Leader. Major subsequently announced on 22 November that he would stand in the second ballot. Major had been at home in Huntingdon recovering from a wisdom tooth operation during the first leadership ballot. Thatcher's nomination papers for the second ballot were sent to him by car for him to sign \u2013 it later emerged that he had signed both Thatcher's papers and a set of papers for his own candidacy in case she withdrew.\n\nUnlike in the first ballot, a candidate only required a simple majority of Conservative MPs to win, in this case 187 of 375 MPs. The ballot was held on the afternoon of 27 November; although Major fell two votes short of the required winning total, he polled far enough ahead of both [[Douglas Hurd]] and [[Michael Heseltine]] to secure immediate concessions from them. With no remaining challengers, Major was formally named Leader of the Conservative Party that evening and was duly appointed Prime Minister the following day.\n\n==Prime Minister==\n{{Further information|First Major ministry|Second Major ministry}}\n\n===1992 election===\n{{Main article|United Kingdom general election, 1992}}\nThe UK economy entered a recession during 1990, which deepened in 1991, with unemployment rising rapidly. The Conservatives had been consistently behind Labour in the opinion polls since 1989, and the gap had widened significantly during 1990. Within two months of Major becoming Prime Minister, Major was required to lead Britain through the first [[Gulf War]], playing a key role in persuading [[President of the United States|US President]] [[George H. W. Bush]] to support [[no-fly zone]]s. During this period, Major and his Cabinet survived an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] assassination attempt by [[Downing Street mortar attack|mortar attack]]. The Conservatives managed to regain a lead in the opinion polls after this period, with polls also showing Major as the most popular Prime Minister since [[Harold Macmillan]] in the early 1960s.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/673348.stm John Major: A life in politics], BBC News, 28 September 2002</ref>\n\nIn spite of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Leader]] [[Neil Kinnock]]'s repeated calls for an immediate general election after Major became Prime Minister, it wasn't until February 1992 that Major called an election for 9 April. Major took his campaign onto the streets, delivering many addresses from an upturned [[soapbox]] as he had done in his days on Lambeth Council. This approach stood in contrast to the Labour Party's seemingly slicker campaign and it chimed with the electorate, along with hard-hitting [[Negative campaigning|negative campaign]] advertising focusing on the issue of Labour's approach to taxation. During the campaign, both parties were either tied or within one point of each other in opinion polls, leading to uncertainty over who would win \u2013 or whether there would be an outright election winner at all. On the night of the election, exit polls indicated a very slim Labour lead, which most observers predicted would translate into either a [[hung parliament]] or a small Labour majority, with Major's best hope of retaining power being with the Tories remaining in government as a minority government or as part of a coalition.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8280050.stm|title=Poll tracker: Interactive guide to the opinion polls|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 March 2010 | date=29 September 2009 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nDespite these predictions, the Conservatives won the election, gaining in excess of 14&nbsp;million votes, the highest popular vote ever recorded by a British political party in a general election to date. Although this translated into a much-reduced majority of 21 seats in the House of Commons, this was enough for Major to return as Prime Minister elected in his own right and give the Conservatives their fourth consecutive victory, although the relatively small majority would go on to cause problems for Major throughout his second term.\n[[File:Arcbushmaj.jpg|thumb|right|John Major with President [[George H. W. Bush]] at [[Camp David]] in 1992]]\n\n===Black Wednesday===\n{{Main article|Black Wednesday}}\nMajor's second honeymoon as Prime Minister following his election victory did not last long. On 16 September 1992, the UK was forced to exit the [[Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM) in difficult circumstances, in a day which would come to be known as \"Black Wednesday\", with billions of pounds wasted in a futile attempt to defend the value of sterling. The upheaval caused by the day's events was such that Major came close to resigning as Prime Minister, preparing an unsent letter of resignation addressed to the Queen.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foi/story/0,,1409254,00.html|title=Treasury papers reveal cost of Black Wednesday |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 9 February 2005|accessdate=2 October 2006  | first=Matthew | last=Tempest}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1483186/Major-was-ready-to-quit-over-Black-Wednesday.html|title= Major was ready to quit over Black Wednesday|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date= 10 February 2005|accessdate=30 September 2009  | first1=Toby | last1=Helm}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Major continued to defend Britain's membership of the ERM, stating that \"the ERM was the medicine to cure the ailment, but it was not the ailment\", the disaster of Black Wednesday left the Government's economic credibility irreparably damaged.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=341}} Major kept his economic team unchanged for seven months after Black Wednesday before eventually sacking [[Norman Lamont]] as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], replacing him with [[Kenneth Clarke]]. This came after months of press criticism of Lamont and a heavy defeat at a by-election in [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]]. His delay in sacking Lamont was exploited by Major's critics both inside and outside of his party, who used it to claim Major was too indecisive. Immediately after Black Wednesday, the Conservatives fell far behind Labour in the opinion polls and Major would never be able to regain the lead for the rest of his time as Prime Minister, being trounced in local council elections and the European parliament elections on the way, as well as suffering a string of by-election defeats which gradually wiped out the Conservative majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/historical-polls/voting-intention-1992-1997 |title=UK Polling Report |publisher=UK Polling Report |accessdate=13 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nLess than a year of his triumphant election victory, public opinion on Major personally plummeted, with Black Wednesday, mine closures, the Maastricht dispute and high unemployment being cited as four key areas of dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister. Newspapers which traditionally supported the Conservatives and had championed Major at the election were now being severely critical of him on an almost daily basis.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/leading-article-john-major-is-he-up-to-the-job-1453316.html | location=London | work=The Independent | date=4 April 1993 | title=Leading Article: John Major: Is he up to the job?}}</ref> The UK's forced withdrawal from the ERM was succeeded by a partial economic recovery with a new policy of flexible [[exchange rate]]s, allowing lower [[interest rate]]s and [[devaluation]], thereby increasing demand for UK goods in export markets. The recession that had started shortly before Major became Prime Minister was declared over in April 1993, when the economy grew by 0.2%. Unemployment also started to fall; it had stood at nearly 3 million by the end of 1992, but the spring of 1997 it had fallen to 1.7 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/26/newsid_2503000/2503271.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &#124; 1993: Recession over&nbsp;\u2013 it's official |publisher=BBC News |date=26 April 1962 |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/wanted-a-wartsandall-tally-of-uks-jobless-1316516.html |title=Wanted: a warts-and-all tally of UK's jobless&nbsp;\u2013 Business, News |work=The Independent |location=London |date=30 December 1996 |accessdate=17 April 2010  | first=John | last=Philpott}}</ref>\n\n===Europe===\nOn becoming Prime Minister, Major had promised to keep Britain \"at the very heart of Europe\", and claimed to have won \"game, set and match for Britain\" \u2013 by negotiating the Social Chapter and Single Currency opt-outs from the Maastricht Treaty, and by ensuring that there was no overt mention of a \"Federal\" Europe and that foreign and defence policy were kept as matters of inter-governmental co-operation, in separate \"pillars\" from the supranational European Union. By 2010 some of these concessions, although not Britain's non-membership of the Single Currency, had been overtaken by subsequent events.\n\nEven these moves towards greater European integration met with vehement opposition from the [[Eurosceptic]] wing of Major's party and his Cabinet, as the Government attempted to ratify the Maastricht Treaty in the first half of 1993. Although Labour supported the treaty, they tactically opposed certain provisions of the Treaty to exploit divisions in the Government. This opposition included passing an amendment that required a vote on the Social Chapter aspects of the Treaty before it could be ratified. On 22 July 1993, several Conservative MPs, known as the [[Maastricht Rebels]], voted against the Treaty, and the Government was defeated. Major called another vote on the following day, which he declared as a [[1993 vote of confidence in the government of John Major|vote of confidence]]. He won the vote but the damage had been done to his authority in Parliament.\n\nLater that day, Major gave an interview to [[ITN]]'s [[Michael Brunson]]. During an unguarded moment when Major thought that the microphones had been switched off, Brunson asked why he did not sack the ministers who were conspiring against him. He replied: \"Just think it through from my perspective. You are the Prime Minister, with a majority of 18&nbsp;... where do you think most of the poison is coming from? From the dispossessed and the never-possessed. Do we want three more of the bastards out there? What's [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s maxim?\"<ref>The maxim referred to is Johnson's famous comment about [[J. Edgar Hoover]]: Johnson had once sought a way to remove Hoover from his post as head of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), but upon realising that the problems involved in such a plan were insurmountable, he accepted Hoover's presence philosophically, reasoning that it would be \"better to have him inside the tent pissing out, than outside pissing in\".</ref> Major later said that he had picked the number three from the air and that he was referring to \"former ministers who had left the government and begun to create havoc with their anti-European activities\",{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=343\u2013344}} but many journalists suggested that the three were [[Peter Lilley]], [[Michael Portillo]] and [[Michael Howard]], three of the more prominent \"[[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]]s\" within his Cabinet.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/1993/jul/25/politicalnews.uk|title=Major hits out at Cabinet|first1=Paul|last1=Routledge|first2=Simon|last2=Hoggart|work=[[The Observer]]|date=25 July 1993|accessdate=10 October 2011|location=London}}</ref> Throughout the rest of Major's time as Prime Minister the exact identity of the three was blurred, with John Redwood's name frequently appearing in a list along with two of the others. The tape of this conversation was leaked to the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and widely reported, embarrassing Major.\n\nBy April 1993, a mere 12 months after his general election triumph, John Major's popularity as Prime Minister had slumped. As well as his party's dismal showings in the opinion polls, Major's own personal ratings in opinion polls were similarly low. He was now being reviled on an almost daily basis by newspapers whose support the Conservatives had once appeared to have taken for granted. Critics from all corners were also criticising his 'consensus' approach to politics, which contrasted sharply to the more confrontational approach of Margaret Thatcher \u2013 while others were keen to point out that a less confrontational approach to the job was something that many observers had been hoping for when Margaret Thatcher was leaving office in 1990. Comparisons were being drawn up with an earlier Conservative prime minister, [[Anthony Eden]] \u2013 who had risen through the ranks as a highly respected government minister before becoming prime minister, only to be seen as a disappointment after he did take over.\n\nArguments continued over Europe. Early in 1994 Major vetoed the Belgian politician [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]] to succeed [[Jacques Delors]] as [[President of the European Commission]] for being excessively federalist, only to find that he had to accept a Luxembourg politician of similar views, [[Jacques Santer]], instead. Around this time Major \u2013 who in an unfortunate phrase denounced the Labour Leader John Smith as \"Monsieur Oui, the poodle of Brussels\" \u2013 tried to demand an increase in the Qualified Majority needed for voting in the newly enlarged European Union (i.e. making it easier for Britain, in alliance with other countries, to block federalist measures). After Major had to back down on this issue [[Antony Marlow|Tony Marlow]] called openly in the House of Commons for his resignation. In 1996 European governments banned British beef over claims that it was infected with [[Mad Cow Disease]] \u2013 the British government withheld co-operation with the EU over the issue, but did not succeed in getting the ban lifted, only a timetable of lifting it. The conflict has been named the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#The ban on British beef|Beef war]]. By April 2013, [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#Epidemiology|vCJD]] - the human form of the disease had killed 280 people (176 of them in Britain).\n\nFor the rest of Major's premiership the main argument was over whether Britain would join the planned European Single Currency. Some leading Conservatives (e.g. Chancellor Ken Clarke) favoured joining and insisted that Britain retain a completely free choice, whilst increasing numbers of others expressed their reluctance to join. By this time billionaire Sir [[James Goldsmith]] had set up his own Referendum Party, siphoning off some Conservative support, and at the 1997 General Election many Conservative candidates were openly expressing reluctance to join.\n\n===Bosnia===\n[[File:John Major-1.JPEG|thumb|Major with Lieutenant General Michael Walker at the Ilidza Compound in [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia]], during [[Operation Joint Endeavor]] ]]\nMajor's premiership saw the ongoing war in [[Bosnia]]. Government policy was to maintain the United Nations arms embargo which restricted the flow of weapons into the region and to oppose air strikes against Bosnian Serbs. The Government's reasoning was that an arms embargo would only create a \"level killing field\" and that air strikes would endanger UN peacekeepers and the humanitarian aid effort. This policy was criticised by Thatcher and others who saw the Bosnian Muslims as the main victims of Serb aggression and compared the situation to events in the Second World War. The [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]], by contrast, was committed to a policy of \"lift and strike\" (lifting the arms embargo and inflicting air strikes on the Serbs) causing tensions in the \"special relationship\" ([[Douglas Hurd]] and others strongly opposed this policy).\n\nSome commentators compared the Major Government's policy to \"amoral equivalency\" because it appeared to judge the Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Serbs equally culpable.<ref>{{cite web|author=Copyright Headshift Ltd, 2003 |url=http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |title=Bosnia Report&nbsp;\u2013 July\u2013September 2000 |publisher=Bosnia.org.uk |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref> To some extent, these critics of Major's policy were later vindicated when, in an article published in 2011, the then-Defence Secretary [[Malcolm Rifkind]] accepted that the arms embargo was a \"serious mistake\" by the UN.<ref>{{cite web|last=Attila |first=Marko |url=http://greatersurbiton.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/sir-malcolm-rifkind-arms-embargo-on-bosnia-was-the-most-serious-mistake-made-by-the-un/ |title=Sir Malcolm Rifkind: Arms embargo on Bosnia was 'the most serious mistake made by the UN' \u00ab Greater Surbiton |publisher=Greatersurbiton.wordpress.com |date=16 March 2011 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Northern Ireland===\nMajor opened talks with the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) upon taking office. When he declared to the House of Commons in November 1993 that \"to sit down and talk with [[Gerry Adams|Mr Adams]] and the Provisional IRA&nbsp;... would turn my stomach\",<ref>{{cite hansard|title=European Council (Special Meeting)|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199293/cmhansrd/1993-11-01/Debate-2.html|date=1 November 1993|column=34|house=House of Commons}}</ref> [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] gave the media an outline of the secret talks indeed held regularly since that February. The [[Downing Street Declaration]] was issued on 15 December 1993 by Major and [[Albert Reynolds]], the Irish [[Taoiseach]], with whom he had a friendly relationship: an IRA ceasefire followed in 1994. In the House of Commons, Major refused to sign up to the first draft of the \"[[George J. Mitchell|Mitchell]] Principles\", which resulted in the ending of the ceasefire. Major paved the way for the [[Good Friday Agreement]], also known as the 'Belfast Agreement', which was signed after he left office.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nIn March 1995, Major refused to answer the phone calls of United States President [[Bill Clinton]] for several days because of his anger at Clinton's decision to invite Gerry Adams to the [[White House]] for [[Saint Patrick's Day|St Patrick's Day]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,12271,1243638,00.html|title='Mandela helped me survive Monicagate, Arafat could not make the leap to peace&nbsp;\u2013 and for days John Major wouldn't take my calls'|work=The Guardian |location=London | date= 21 June 2004 | accessdate=17 September 2006 | first=Alan | last=Rusbridger}}</ref>\n\n===Rail===\n[[File:Rail modal share.png|thumb|300px|Graph showing rail modal share (rail's share of total travel), from 1952 to 2014<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/482670/tsgb0101.xls|title=Rail modal share 1952\u20132014|website=[[Gov.uk]]|accessdate=3 February 2016}}</ref>]]\nFrom 1994 to 1997, Major [[privatisation of British Rail|privatised British rail]], splitting it up into [[Passenger rail franchising in Great Britain|franchises to be run by the private sector]]. The process was controversial at the time, and its [[impact of the privatisation of British Rail|success is hotly debated]], with a large increase in passenger numbers and investment in the network balanced by worries about the level of [[rail subsidy]].\n\n===\"Sleaze\"===\nAt the 1993 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] Conference, Major began the \"[[Back to Basics (campaign)|Back to Basics]]\" campaign, which he intended to also be about a wide variety of issues including the economy, education and policing, but which was interpreted by many (including Conservative cabinet ministers) purely in the context of returning to the moral and [[family values]] that they associated with the Conservative Party.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=403\u2013408}}\n\nInstead of being well received, \"Back to Basics\" instead became synonymous with scandal, often exposed in lurid and embarrassing detail by [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid newspapers]] such as ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''. In 1992, [[David Mellor]], a cabinet minister, had been exposed as having an extramarital affair and for accepting hospitality from the daughter of a leading member of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]].{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=300\u2013324}} The wife of the [[Malcolm Sinclair, 20th Earl of Caithness|Earl of Caithness]] committed suicide amongst rumours of the Earl committing adultery.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=433}} [[Stephen Milligan]] was found dead having apparently auto-asphyxiated whilst performing a solitary sex act (his Eastleigh seat was lost in what was to be an ongoing stream of hefty by-election defeats).{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=439}} [[David Ashby]] was \"[[Coming out|outed]]\" by his wife after sleeping with men.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=433}} A string of other Conservative MPs, including [[Alan Amos]], [[Tim Yeo]], and [[Michael Brown (British politician)|Michael Brown]], were involved in sexual scandals.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=431\u2013433}}\n\nOther debilitating scandals included \"Arms to Iraq\" \u2013 the ongoing inquiry into how government ministers including [[Alan Clark]] (also involved in an unrelated scandal involving the revelation of his affair with the wife and both daughters of a South African judge) had encouraged businesses to supply arms to Iraq during the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s, in breach of the official arms embargo, and how senior ministers had, on legal advice, attempted to withhold evidence of this official connivance when directors of Matrix Churchill were put on trial for breaking the embargo.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=344\u2013345}}\n\nAnother scandal was \"[[Cash for Questions]]\", in which first [[Graham Riddick]], and [[David Tredinnick (politician)|David Tredinnick]] accepted money to ask questions in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in a newspaper \"sting\", and later [[Tim Smith (British politician)|Tim Smith]] and [[Neil Hamilton (politician)|Neil Hamilton]] were found to have received money from [[Mohamed Al-Fayed]], also to ask questions in the [[British House of Commons|House]]. Later, [[David Willetts]] resigned as [[Paymaster General]] after he was accused of rigging evidence to do with ''Cash for Questions''.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=476, 500\u2013501, 691}}\n\nDefence Minister [[Jonathan Aitken]] was accused by the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[investigative journalism]] series ''[[World in Action]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper of secretly doing deals with leading Saudi princes. He denied all accusations and promised to wield the \"sword of truth\" in libel proceedings which he brought against ''The Guardian'' and the producers of ''World in Action'' [[Granada Television]]. At an early stage in the trial, it became apparent that he had lied under oath, and he was subsequently (after the Major government had fallen from power) convicted of perjury and sentenced to a term of imprisonment.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=480, 500\u2013502}}\n\nMajor attempted to draw some of the sting from the financial scandals by setting up public inquiries \u2013 the Nolan Report into standards expected in public life, and the Scott Report into the Arms to Iraq Scandal.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=344\u2013345, 501}}\n\nAlthough [[Tim Smith (British politician)|Tim Smith]] stepped down from the House of Commons at the 1997 General Election, both Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken sought re-election for their seats, and were both defeated, in Hamilton's case by the former BBC Reporter [[Martin Bell]], who stood as an anti-sleaze candidate, both the Labour and Liberal Democrat candidates withdrawing in his favour, amidst further publicity unfavourable to the Conservatives.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=717\u2013719}}\n\nMajor later commented in his memoirs on the \"routine\" with which he would be telephoned over the weekend to be warned of the latest embarrassing story due to break. He wrote that he took a stern line against financial impropriety, but was angered at the way in which a host of scandals, many of them petty sexual misdemeanours by a small number of MPs, were exploited by the press and Opposition for political advantage. He also conceded that the issue \"fed the public belief that the Conservative(s)&nbsp;... had been in government too long, and had got into bad habits\" and quoted Labour's claim in 1997: \"Nothing better encapsulates what people think of this government. Sleaze will be one of the things which brings this government down.\"{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=550\u2013552}}\n\n===Leadership crisis===\nOn 22 June 1995, tired of continual threats of leadership challenges that never arose, Major resigned as Leader of the Conservative Party and announced he would contest the resulting [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1995|leadership election]] \u2013 he continued to serve as Prime Minister while the leadership was vacant, but would have resigned had he not been re-elected by a large enough majority. [[John Redwood]] resigned as [[Secretary of State for Wales]] to stand against him. Major won by 218 votes to Redwood's 89, with 12 spoiled ballots, eight 'active' abstentions and two MPs abstaining, enough to easily win in the first round. The amount was three more than the target he had privately set himself, having earlier resolved to resign if he could not carry the support at least 215 of his MPs.{{sfn|Major|1999}}\n\n''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, still at this stage supporting the Conservative Party, had lost faith in Major and declared its support for Redwood in the leadership election, running the front page headline \"Redwood versus Deadwood\".<ref>{{cite news |title=PM assails 'malcontent' Redwood |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/pm-assails-malcontent-redwood-1588458.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first1=Donald | last1=Macintyre | first2=Colin | last2=Brown | date=27 June 1995}}</ref>\n\n===1997 election and resignation===\nMajor's comfortable re-election as Conservative Leader failed to restore his authority. Despite efforts to improve the popularity of the Conservative Party, Labour remained far ahead in the opinion polls as the election loomed, despite the economic boom that had followed the exit from recession four years earlier, and the swift fall in unemployment. By December 1996, by-election losses and defections meant that the Conservatives had lost their majority in the House of Commons. Major managed to survive to the end of the Parliament, leading what had effectively become a minority government, and called an election on 17 March 1997 as the five-year limit for its timing approached. Major had deliberately delayed the election until close to the last possible moment in the hope that a still-improving economy would help the Conservatives hold a greater number of seats, and that voters would be deterred from Labour by exposing the party's policies with slogans like \"New Labour, New Danger\".\n\nUnfortunately for John Major, his attempts to win public support and swing the election in favour of the Tories did not work. Even ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, which had championed the Conservatives five years earlier and claimed to have won the 1992 general election for the party, declared its support for [[Tony Blair]]'s \"New Labour\", condemning the Tories as \"tired, divided and rudderless\".\n\nOn 1 May 1997, the Conservative Party suffered the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|worst electoral defeat]] by a ruling party since the [[Reform Act 1832]]. In the new Parliament, Labour held 418 seats, the Conservatives 165, and the Liberal Democrats 46, giving Labour a majority of 179; it was the lowest number of Conservative seats in Parliament for over a century, and the new political landscape appeared likely to guarantee Labour at least two successive parliamentary terms in government. Major himself was re-elected in his own constituency of Huntingdon with an increased majority of 18,140, but 179 other Conservative MPs were defeated, including present and former Cabinet Ministers such as Norman Lamont, Malcolm Rifkind and Michael Portillo. The huge election defeat also left the Conservatives without any MPs in Scotland or Wales for the first time in history. The party would not return to government until [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010]], and did not win a parliamentary majority until [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015]] (both victories being achieved under the leadership of [[David Cameron]]).\n\nThe following day Major travelled to [[Buckingham Palace]] to inform the Queen of his resignation as Prime Minister. Shortly before this he had announced his intention to also resign as Conservative Leader, giving his final statement outside [[10 Downing Street]] in which he said; \"When the curtain falls, it is time to get off the stage\u2014and that is what I propose to do.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnmajor.co.uk/page824.html|title=Mr Major's Resignation Statement|date=27 June 2011}}</ref> Major then famously announced to the press that he intended to go with his family to [[The Oval]] to watch [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] play cricket.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\n==Final years in Parliament (until 2001)==\nAlthough many Conservative MPs wanted Major to resign as leader immediately, there was a movement among the grassroots of the party, encouraged by his political allies, to have him stay on as leader until the autumn. [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 7th Marquess of Salisbury|Viscount Cranborne]], his Chief of Staff during the election, and the Chief Whip, [[Alastair Goodlad]], both pleaded with him to stay on. They argued that remaining as leader for a few months would give the party time to come to terms with the scale of defeat before electing a successor.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=38\u201339}} Major refused, saying: \"It would be terrible, because I would be presiding with no authority over a number of candidates fighting for the crown. It would merely prolong the agony.\"{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\nMajor served as [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] for seven weeks whilst the [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1997|leadership election]] to replace him was underway. He formed [[Shadow Cabinet of John Major|a temporary Shadow Cabinet]], but with seven of his Cabinet Ministers having lost their seats at the election, and with few senior MPs left to replace them, several MPs had to hold multiple briefs.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major himself served as [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] and [[Shadow Secretary of State for Defence]], and the office of [[Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland|Shadow Scotland Secretary]] was left vacant until after the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]] as the party had no MPs from Scotland.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major's resignation as Conservative Leader formally took effect on 19 June 1997 after the election of [[William Hague]]. His [[1997 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours|Resignation Honours]] were announced in August 1997.\n\nMajor remained active in Parliament after his resignation, regularly attending and contributing in debates. He stood down from the House of Commons at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]], having announced his retirement live on [[BBC One]]'s breakfast television show with [[David Frost]] in October 2000.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/breakfast_with_frost/962625.stm |title=Interview on ''Breakfast With Frost'' |publisher=BBC News  |date=8 October 2000 |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Summary==\nMajor's mild-mannered style and moderate political stance made him theoretically well-placed to act as a conciliatory leader of his party. In spite of this, conflict raged within the Parliamentary Conservative Party, particularly over the extent of Britain's integration with the [[European Union]]. Major never succeeded in reconciling the \"Euro-rebels\" among his MPs to his European policy, who although relatively few in number \u2013 in spite of the fact that their views were much more widely supported amongst Conservative activists and voters \u2013 wielded great influence because of his small majority, and episodes such as the Maastricht Rebellion inflicted serious political damage on him and his government. The additional bitterness on the right wing of the Conservative Party at the manner in which [[Margaret Thatcher]] had been removed from office did not make Major's task any easier. A series of scandals among leading Conservative MPs also did Major and his government no favours. His task became even more difficult after the well-received election of Tony Blair as [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Leader]] in July 1994.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/7593554.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=Who has been UK's greatest post-war PM? | date=16 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nMajor defended his government in his memoirs, focusing particularly on how under him the British economy had recovered from the recession of 1990\u201392. He wrote that, \"During my premiership interest rates fell from 14% to 6%; unemployment was at 1.75&nbsp;million when I took office, and at 1.6&nbsp;million and falling upon my departure; and the government's annual borrowing rose from [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]0.5&nbsp;billion to nearly \u00a346&nbsp;billion at its peak before falling to \u00a31&nbsp;billion\".{{sfn|Major|2000|p=689}}\n\nThe former Labour MP [[Tony Banks, Baron Stratford|Tony Banks]] said of Major in 1994 that, \"He was a fairly competent Chairman of Housing on Lambeth Council.

I can't believe he's here and sometimes I think he can't either.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,1682818,00.html|title=The Right Hon wag|date= 10 January 2006|accessdate=17 September 2006|work=The Guardian |location=London  | first=Iain | last=Dale}}</ref> [[Paddy Ashdown]], the Leader of the [[Liberal Democrats]] during Major's term of office, once described him in the House of Commons as a \"decent and honourable man\".

Major's appearance was noted in its greyness, his prodigious [[philtrum]], and large glasses, all of which were exaggerated in caricatures. For example, in ''[[Spitting Image]]'', Major's puppet was changed from a circus performer to that of a grey man who ate dinner with his wife in silence, occasionally saying \"nice peas, dear\", whilst at the same time nursing an unrequited crush on his colleague [[Virginia Bottomley]] \u2013 an invention, but an ironic one in view of his affair with [[Edwina Currie]], which was not then a matter of public knowledge. By the end of his premiership his puppet would often be shown observing the latest fiasco and ineffectually murmuring \"oh dear\".\n\nThe media (particularly ''[[The Guardian]]'' cartoonist [[Steve Bell (cartoonist)|Steve Bell]]) used the allegation by [[Alastair Campbell]] that he had observed Major tucking his shirt into his underpants to [[caricature]] him wearing his pants outside his trousers,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/cartoons/stevebell/0,MFEM,802577,00.html |title=If only we had known back then |work=The Guardian |location=London |author=Steve Bell |authorlink=Steve Bell (cartoonist) |date=1 October 2002 |accessdate=17 September 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060223223113/http://www.guardian.co.uk/cartoons/stevebell/0,MFEM,802577,00.html |archivedate=23 February 2006 }}</ref> as a pale grey echo of both [[Superman]] and [[Supermac (cartoon)|Supermac]], a parody of [[Harold Macmillan]]. Bell also used the humorous possibilities of the [[Cones Hotline]], a means for the public to inform the authorities of potentially unnecessary [[traffic cone]]s, which was part of the [[Citizen's Charter]] project established by John Major.\n\n''[[Private Eye]]'' parodied [[Sue Townsend]]'s ''The Secret Diary of [[Adrian Mole]], age 13\u00be'' to write ''[[Prime Minister parodies (Private Eye)#John Major: The Secret Diary of John Major (aged 47\u00be)|The Secret Diary of John Major, age 47\u00be]]'', in which Major was portrayed as a naive nincompoop (e.g. keeping lists of his enemies in a Rymans Notebook called his \"Bastards Book\") and featuring \"my wife Norman\" and \"[[Brian Mawhinney, Baron Mawhinney|Mr Dr Mawhinney]]\" as [[recurring character]]s. The magazine still runs one-off specials of this diary (with the age updated) on occasions when Major is in the news, such as on the breaking of the Edwina Currie story or the publication of his autobiography. The magazine also ran a series of cartoons called ''101 Uses for a John Major'' (based on a comic book of some ten years earlier, called ''[[101 Uses for a Dead Cat]]''), in which Major was illustrated serving a number of bizarre purposes, such as a train-spotter's anorak. <!-- Reference at http://catalogue.bl.uk/F/LG58CGKV3EVJCXLYJJH461GPDNH8KSVKIKFX4YQHYNUQ6PT4BD-02109?func=full-set-set&set_number=122950&set_entry=000001&format=999 requires sign-in -->\n\nMajor's Brixton roots were used in a campaign poster during the Conservative Party's 1992 election campaign: \"What does the Conservative Party offer a working class kid from Brixton?
