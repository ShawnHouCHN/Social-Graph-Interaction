One of that company\\'s subsidiaries was [[AT&T Corporation|American Telephone and Telegraph Company]] (AT&T), established in 1885, which acquired the Bell Company on December 31, 1899 for legal reasons, leaving AT&T as the main company. AT&T established a network of subsidiaries in the United States and Canada that held a government-authorized phone service [[monopoly]], formalized with the [[Kingsbury Commitment]], throughout most of the twentieth century. This monopoly was known as the [[Bell System]], and during this period, AT&T was also known by the nickname Ma Bell. For periods of time, the former AT&T was the world\\'s largest phone company.\\n\\n===Breakup and reformation (1982-2004)===\\n{{See also|Breakup of AT&T|History of AT&T#Post break-up restructuring}}\\nIn 1982, U.S. regulators [[Breakup of the Bell System|broke up the AT&T monopoly]], requiring AT&T to divest its regional subsidiaries and turning them each into individual companies. These new companies were known as [[Regional Bell Operating Companies]], or more informally, Baby Bells.   AT&T continued to operate long distance services, but as a result of this breakup, faced competition from new competitors such as [[MCI Communications|MCI]] and [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]].\\n\\nSouthwestern Bell was one of the companies created by the breakup of AT&T. The architect of divestiture for Southwestern Bell was Robert G. Pope.  The company soon started a series of acquisitions. This includes the 1987 acquisition of [[Metromedia]] mobile business, and the acquisition of several cable companies in the early 1990s. In the later half of the 1990s, the company acquired several other telecommunications companies, including some Baby Bells, while selling its cable business. During this time, the company changed its name to SBC Communications. By 1998, the company was in the top 15 of the [[Fortune 500]], and by 1999 the company was part of the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] (lasting through 2015).\\n\\n===SBC purchase and acquisitions (2005-2014)===\\n{{See also|History of AT&T#Rise of SBC|History of AT&T#Post-consolidation wireless acquisitions}}\\nIn 2005, SBC purchased AT&T for $16 billion. After this purchase, SBC adopted the better-known AT&T name and brand, with the original AT&T still existing as the long-distance landline subsidiary of the merged company. The current AT&T claims the original AT&T\\'s history (dating to 1885) as its own, though its corporate structure only dates from 1983.<ref>{{cite

Following the company\\u2019s creation, the focus began to shift towards organisation with the construction of a warehouse in Saint-\\xc9tienne.<ref>[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/casino-guichard-perrachon-s-a-history/ Casino Guichard-Perrachon S.A. History], \\'\\'fundinguniverse.com\\'\\'</ref>\\n\\nThe first Casino-brand products were launched in 1901, introducing the concept of private brands. 1902 saw the introduction of a customer loyalty programme that offered trading stamps for store purchases. The first factories in the [[Loire (department)|Loire region]] were opened four years later and by 1916 the company had introduced a family allowance fund and a proft-sharing system for their employees.<ref>[http://www.groupe-casino.fr/en/the-group/history/ Groupe Casino History], \\'\\'groupe-casino.fr/en\\'\\'</ref>\\n\\nThe first self-service store was opened in 1948 followed by the installation of France\\u2019s first refigerated display in 1949. Almost a decade later, Casino became the first French food retailer to display a sell-by date on their products, a practice that did not become mandatory in France until 1984. In 1975,  Casino joined the global market through its expansion into the United States.\\n\\nBy 1992, the group had acquired \\'\\'La Ruche M\\xe9ridionale\\'\\' before merging with Rallye, a French retailer owned by Jean-Charles Naouri, by giving 30% of Casino. 1997 saw the development of a hostile takeover bid from retailer Promod\\xe8s. However, the bid fell through due to the combined efforts of Jean-Charles Naouri, the Guichard family, and the Group\\u2019s employees. The following year, Jean-Charles Naouri became the Group\\u2019s majority shareholder.\\n\\nBetween 2000 and 2001, Casino acquired 50% of the variety retailer [[Monoprix]] as well as the discount chains [[Franprix]], [[Leader Price]], and [[Cdiscount]]. Banque Casino was founded and the property company [[Mercialys]] is established to manage the Group\\u2019s shopping centers.
