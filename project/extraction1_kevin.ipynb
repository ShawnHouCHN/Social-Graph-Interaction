At the apartment of Franz Fikentscher, they discussed how to come up with a new name for the company. During this meeting, Franz\\'s son was quietly studying Latin in a corner of the room.

Audi.com</ref> In the same year, Rasmussen bought the remains of the U.S. [[automobile manufacturer]] [[Rickenbacker (car)|Rickenbacker]], including the manufacturing equipment for eight-cylinder engines. These engines were used in \\'\\'Audi Zwickau\\'\\' and \\'\\'Audi Dresden\\'\\' models that were launched in 1929. At the same time, six-cylinder and four-cylinder ([[Audi Type P|the \"four\"]] with a [[Peugeot]] engine) models were manufactured. Audi cars of that era were luxurious cars equipped with special bodywork.\\n\\nIn 1932, Audi merged with [[Horch]], DKW, and [[Wanderer (car)|Wanderer]], to form [[Auto Union]] AG, [[Chemnitz]]. It was during this period that the company offered the [[Audi Front]] that became the first European car to combine a six-cylinder engine with front-wheel drive. It used a powertrain shared with the Wanderer, but turned 180-degrees, so that the drive shaft faced the front.\\n\\nBefore [[World War II]], Auto Union used the four interlinked rings that make up the Audi badge today, representing these four brands. This badge was used, however, only on Auto Union racing cars in that period while the member companies used their own names and emblems. The technological development became more and more concentrated and some Audi models were propelled by Horch or Wanderer built engines.\\n\\nReflecting the economic pressures of the time, Auto Union concentrated increasingly on smaller cars through the 1930s, so that by 1938 the company\\'s DKW brand accounted for 17.9% of the German car market, while Audi held only 0.1%. After the final few Audis were delivered in 1939 the \"Audi\" name disappeared completely from the new car market for more than two decades.\\n\\n===Post-World War II===\\n[[File:IFA F9 front 20040924.jpg|thumb|[[IFA F9]]]]\\nLike most German manufacturing, at the onset of World War II the Auto Union plants were retooled for military production, and were a target for allied bombing during the war which left them damaged.\\n\\nOverrun by the [[Soviet Army]] in 1945, on the orders of the Soviet Union military administration the factories were dismantled as part of [[war reparations]].<ref name=\"chronicle6\"/> Following this, the company\\'s entire assets were expropriated without compensation.<ref name=\"chronicle6\"/> On 17 August 1948, Auto Union AG of Chemnitz was deleted from the commercial register.<ref name=\"chronicle4\"/> These actions had the effect of liquidating Germany\\'s Auto Union AG. The remains of the Audi plant of Zwickau became the [[Volkseigener Betrieb|VEB]] (for \"People Owned Enterprise\") [[:de:Automobilwerk Zwickau|Automobilwerk Zwickau]] or AWZ (in English: Automobile Works Zwickau).\\n\\nWith no prospect of continuing production in Soviet controlled East Germany, Auto Union executives began the process of relocating what was left of the company to [[West Germany]].  A site was chosen in [[Ingolstadt]], [[Bavaria]] to start a spare parts operation in late 1945, which would eventually serve as the headquarters of the reformed Auto Union in 1949.\\n\\nThe former Audi factory in Zwickau restarted assembly of the pre-war-models in 1949. These DKW models were renamed to [[IFA F8]] and [[IFA F9]] and were similar to the West German versions. West and East German models were equipped with the traditional and renowned DKW two-stroke engines. The Zwickau plant manufactured the infamous [[Trabant]] until 1991, when it came under Volkswagen control\\u2014effectively bringing it under the same umbrella as Audi since 1945.\\n\\n===New Auto Union unit===\\nA new West German headquartered Auto Union was launched in Ingolstadt, Bavaria with loans from the Bavarian state government and [[Marshall Plan]] aid.<ref name=\"chronicle6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.audi.com/audi/com/en2/about_audi_ag/history/chronicle/chronicle_1945_1959.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204031240/http://www.audi.com/audi/com/en2/about_audi_ag/history/chronicle/chronicle_1945_1959.html|archivedate=4 February 2009 |title=Audi Worldwide: Home |publisher=Audi.com |date=15 April 2009 |accessdate=27 April 2009}}</ref> The reformed company was launched 3 September 1949 and continued DKW\\'s tradition of producing front-wheel drive vehicles with two-stroke engines.<ref name=\"chronicle6\"/> This included production of a small but sturdy 125&nbsp;cc motorcycle and a DKW delivery van, the [[DKW Schnellaster|DKW F89 L]] at Ingolstadt. The Ingolstadt site was large, consisting of an extensive complex of formerly military buildings which was suitable for administration as well as vehicle warehousing and distribution, but at this stage there was at Ingolstadt no dedicated plant suitable for mass production of automobiles: for manufacturing the company\\'s [[DKW F89|first post-war mass-market passenger car]] plant capacity in [[D\\xfcsseldorf]] was rented from [[Rheinmetall|Rheinmetall-Borsig]]. It was only ten years later, after the company had attracted an investor that funds became available for construction of major car plant at the Ingolstadt head office site.\\n\\nIn 1958, in response to pressure from [[Friedrich Flick]], then their largest single shareholder,<ref>[[#Oswald|Oswald]], p 263</ref> [[Daimler-Benz]] took an 87% holding in the Auto Union company, and this was increased to a 100% holding in 1959. However, small two-stroke cars were not the focus of Daimler-Benz\\'s interests, and while the early 1960s saw major investment in new Mercedes models and in a state of the art factory for Auto Union\\'s, the company\\'s aging model range at this time did not benefit from the economic boom of the early 1960s to the same extent as competitor manufacturers such as  [[Volkswagen]] and [[Opel]]. The decision to dispose of the Auto Union business was based on its lack of profitability.<ref name=Motor197107>{{cite journal| first=Charles | last=Bulmer (Ed)| title = The Audi-NSU Affair| journal=Motor| page =21|date = 24 July 1971}}</ref>  Ironically, by the time they sold the business, it also included a large new factory and near production-ready modern four-stroke engine, which would enable the Auto Union business, under a new owner, to embark on a period of profitable growth, now producing not Auto Unions or DKWs, but using the \"Audi\" name, resurrected in 1965 after a 25-year gap.\\n\\nIn 1964, Volkswagen acquired a 50% holding in the business, which included the new factory in Ingolstadt, the DKW and Audi brands along with the rights to the new engine design which had been funded by Daimler-Benz, who in return retained the dormant Horch trademark and the D\\xfcsseldorf factory which became a Mercedes-Benz van assembly plant. Eighteen months later, Volkswagen bought complete control of Ingolstadt, and by 1966 were using the spare capacity of the Ingolstadt plant to assemble an additional 60,000 [[Volkswagen Type 1|Volkswagen Beetles]] per year.<ref name=Motor19710724>{{cite journal| first=Philip |last=Turner| title = Turner\\'s Travel [to Wolfsburg]| journal=Motor| pages = 28\\u201330|date = 24 July 1971}}</ref>  Two-stroke engines became less popular during the 1960s as customers were more attracted to the smoother four-stroke engines. In September 1965, the [[DKW F102]] was fitted with a four-stroke engine and a [[Facelift (automotive)|facelift]] for the car\\'s front and rear. Volkswagen dumped the DKW brand because of its associations with two-stroke technology, and having classified the model internally as the [[Audi F103|F103]], sold it simply as the \"Audi.\" Later developments of the model were named after their horsepower ratings and sold as the Audi 60, 75, 80, and Super 90, selling until 1972. Initially, Volkswagen was hostile to the idea of Auto Union as a standalone entity producing its own models having acquired the company merely to boost its own production capacity through the Ingolstadt assembly plant - to the point where Volkswagen executives ordered that the Auto Union name and flags bearing the four rings were removed from the factory buildings. Then VW chief [[Heinrich Nordhoff|Heinz Nordhoff]] explicitly forbade Auto Union from any further product development. Fearing that the Volkswagen had no long term ambition for the Audi brand, Auto Union engineers under the leadership of Ludwig Kraus developed the first [[Audi 100]] in secret, without Nordhoff\\'s knowledge. When presented with a finished prototype, Nordhoff was so impressed he authorised the car for production, which when launched in 1968, went on to be a huge success. With this, the resurrection of the Audi brand was now complete, this being followed by the first generation [[Audi 80#B1 (1972\\u201378)|Audi 80]] in 1972, which would in turn provide a template for VW\\'s new front-wheel-drive water-cooled range which debuted from the mid-1970s onward.\\n\\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F038791-0035, Wolfsburg, VW Autowerk.jpg|thumb|[[Audi 80]] [[assembly line]] in [[Wolfsburg]], 1973]]\\nIn 1969, Auto Union merged with [[NSU Motorenwerke AG|NSU]], based in [[Neckarsulm]], near [[Stuttgart]]. In the 1950s, NSU had been the world\\'s largest manufacturer of motorcycles, but had moved on to produce small cars like the [[NSU Prinz]], the TT and TTS versions of which are still popular as vintage race cars. NSU then focused on new rotary engines based on the ideas of [[Felix Wankel]]. In 1967, the new [[NSU Ro 80]] was a car well ahead of its time in technical details such as aerodynamics, light weight, and safety. However, teething problems with the rotary engines put an end to the independence of NSU. The Neckarsulm plant is now used to produce the larger Audi models [[Audi A6|A6]] and [[Audi A8|A8]]. The Neckarsulm factory is also home of the [[quattro GmbH]], a subsidiary responsible for development and production of Audi high-performance models: the [[Audi R8 (road car)|R8]] and the \\'\\'\\'\"RS\"\\'\\'\\' model range.\\n\\n===Modern era===\\nThe new merged company was incorporated on 1 January 1969 and was known as \\'\\'\\'Audi NSU Auto Union AG\\'\\'\\', with its headquarters based at NSU\\'s Neckarsulm plant, and saw the emergence of Audi as a separate brand for the first time since the pre-war era. Volkswagen introduced the Audi brand to the United States for the 1970 model year.  That same year, the mid-sized car that NSU had been working on, the [[VW K70|K70]], originally intended to slot between the rear-engined Prinz models and the futuristic [[NSU Ro 80]], was instead launched as a Volkswagen.\\n\\nAfter the launch of the [[Audi 100]] of 1968, the [[Audi 80]]/Fox (which formed the basis for the 1973 [[Volkswagen Passat]]) followed in 1972 and the [[Audi 50]] (later rebadged as the [[Volkswagen Polo]]) in 1974. The Audi 50 was a seminal design because it was the first incarnation of the [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf/Polo]] concept, one that led to a hugely successful world car.  Ultimately, the Audi 80 and 100 (progenitors of the [[Audi A4|A4]] and [[Audi A6|A6]], respectively) became the company\\'s biggest sellers, whilst little investment was made in the fading NSU range; the [[NSU Prinz|Prinz]] models were dropped in 1973 whilst the fatally flawed [[NSU Ro80]] went out of production in 1977, spelling the effective end of the NSU brand.  Production of the Audi 100 had been steadily moved from Ingolstadt to Neckarsulm as the 1970s had progressed, any by the appearance of the second generation C2 version in 1976, all production was now at the former NSU plant.  Neckarsulm from that point onward would produce Audi\\'s higher end models.\\n\\nThe Audi image at this time was a conservative one, and so, a proposal from chassis engineer [[J\\xf6rg Bensinger]]<ref>{{cite web\\n|url = http://www.worldcarfans.com/news.cfm/newsID/2050225.007/country/gcf/audi/audi-quattro-the-early-years\\n|title = Quattro, The early years\\n|accessdate =2 November 2006\\n}}</ref> was accepted to develop the [[four-wheel drive]] technology in [[Volkswagen]]\\'s [[Volkswagen Iltis|Iltis]] military vehicle for an Audi performance car and [[Rallying|rally]] racing car. The performance car, introduced in 1980, was named the \"[[Audi Quattro]]\", a [[turbo]]charged coup\\xe9 which was also the first German large-scale production vehicle to feature permanent [[all-wheel drive]] through a centre [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]]. Commonly referred to as the \"Ur-Quattro\" (the \"[[Proto-World language|Ur-]]\" prefix is a German [[augmentative]] used, in this case, to mean \"original\" and is also applied to the first generation of Audi\\'s [[Audi S4|S4]] and [[Audi S6|S6]] Sport Saloons, as in \"UrS4\" and \"UrS6\"), few of these vehicles were produced (all hand-built by a single team), but the model was a great success in rallying. Prominent wins proved the viability of all-wheel drive racecars, and the Audi name became associated with advances in automotive technology.\\n\\nIn 1985, with the Auto Union and NSU brands effectively dead, the company\\'s official name was now shortened to simply \\'\\'\\'Audi AG\\'\\'\\'.  At the same time the company\\'s headquarters moved back to Ingolstadt and two new wholly owned subsidiaries; \\'\\'Auto Union GmbH\\'\\' and \\'\\'NSU GmbH\\'\\', were formed to own and manage the historical trademarks and intellectual property of the original constituent companies (the exception being Horch, which had been retained by Daimler-Benz after the VW takeover), and to operate Audi\\'s heritage operations.\\n\\n[[File:Audi Quattro 20V - 001.jpg|thumb|right|[[Audi Quattro]]]]\\nIn 1986, as the Passat-based [[Audi 80]] was beginning to develop a kind of \"grandfather\\'s car\" image, the \\'\\'type 89\\'\\' was introduced. This completely new development sold extremely well. However, its modern and dynamic exterior belied the low performance of its base engine, and its base package was quite spartan (even the passenger-side mirror was an option.) In 1987, Audi put forward a new and very elegant [[Audi 90]], which had a much superior set of standard features. In the early 1990s, sales began to slump for the Audi 80 series, and some basic construction problems started to surface.\\n\\nIn the early part of the 21st century, Audi set forth on a German racetrack to claim and maintain several world records, such as top speed endurance. This effort was in-line with the company\\'s heritage from the 1930s racing era [[Silver Arrows]].\\n\\nThrough the early 1990s, Audi began to shift its target market upscale to compete against German automakers [[Mercedes-Benz]] and [[BMW]]. This began with the release of the [[Audi V8]] in 1990. It was essentially a new engine fitted to the Audi 100/200, but with noticeable bodywork differences. Most obvious was the new grille that was now incorporated in the bonnet.\\n\\nBy 1991, Audi had the four-cylinder Audi 80, the 5-cylinder [[Audi 80|Audi 90]] and [[Audi 100]], the turbocharged [[Audi 100|Audi 200]] and the Audi V8. There was also a coupe version of the 80/90 with both 4- and 5-cylinder engines.\\n\\nAlthough the five-cylinder engine was a successful and robust powerplant, it was still a little too different for the target market. With the introduction of an all-new Audi 100 in 1992, Audi introduced a 2.8L [[V6 engine]]. This engine was also fitted to a face-lifted Audi 80 (all 80 and 90 models were now badged 80 except for the USA), giving this model a choice of four-, five-, and six-cylinder engines, in [[Saloon (automobile)|Saloon]], [[Coup\\xe9]] and [[Cabriolet (automobile)|Cabriolet]] body styles.\\n\\nThe five-cylinder was soon dropped as a major engine choice; however, a [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] {{convert|230|hp|kW|abbr=on}} version remained. The engine, initially fitted to the 200 quattro 20V of 1991, was a derivative of the engine fitted to the [[Audi Quattro#Sport Quattro|Sport Quattro]]. It was fitted to the [[Audi Coup\\xe9]], and named the [[Audi S2|S2]] and also to the Audi 100 body, and named the [[Audi S4|S4]]. These two models were the beginning of the mass-produced [[Audi S models|S series]] of performance cars.\\n\\nIn November 2016, Audi expressed an intention to establish an assembly factory in [[Pakistan]], with the company\\'s local partner acquiring land for a plant in [[Korangi Creek Industrial Park]] in [[Karachi]]. Approval of the plan would lead to an investment of $30 million in the new plant.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/1231159/audi-ag-expresses-intent-assemble-vehicles-pakistan/|title=Audi AG expresses intent to assemble vehicles in Pakistan - The Express Tribune|date=2016-11-15|newspaper=The Express Tribune|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-15}}</ref>\\n\\n===Audi 5000 unintended acceleration allegations===\\nSales in the United States fell after a series of recalls from 1982 to 1987 of [[Audi 5000]] models<ref name=\"bus week\">{{cite journal | title = Audi 1980s Scare May Mean Lost Generation for Toyota | journal=Business Week| date=4 February 2010|first=Andreas|last=Cremer|first2=Tom|last2=Lavell| url = http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-02-04/audi-s-1980s-scare-may-mean-lost-generation-for-toyota-sales.html| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100208162109/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-02-04/audi-s-1980s-scare-may-mean-lost-generation-for-toyota-sales.html| archivedate = 8 February 2010| accessdate=15 August 2010}}</ref> associated with reported incidents of [[sudden unintended acceleration]] linked to six deaths and 700 accidents.<ref name=\"bus week\"/>  At the time, NHTSA was investigating 50 car models from 20 manufacturers for sudden surges of power.<ref name=\"renamed\">{{cite news | title = A Hard Sell for Audi | newspaper=The New York Times|first=John|last=Holusha|date=24 July 1988 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/24/business/a-hard-sell-for-audi.html?scp=14&sq=audi%20sudden%20acceleration&st=cse | accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref>\\n\\nA \\'\\'[[60 Minutes]]\\'\\' report aired 23 November 1986,<ref name=\"debacle\">{{cite web | title = The Audi 5000 Intended Unintended acceleration Debacle | publisher=The Truth About Cars | first = Paul | last = Niedermeyer | date = 7 March 2010 | url = http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/the-best-of-ttac-the-audi-5000-intended-unintended-acceleration-debacle/| accessdate=15 August 2010}}</ref> featuring interviews with six people who had sued Audi after reporting unintended acceleration, showing an Audi 5000 ostensibly suffering a problem when the brake pedal was pushed.<ref name=\"huber\">{{cite web|first=Peter|last=Huber|url=http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/cjm_18.htm|title=Manufacturing the Audi Scare|date=January 1990|publisher=Manhattan Institute for Policy Research|accessdate=15 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Accuracy in Media |url=http://www.aim.org/media-monitor/the-cbs-cold-case-files/|title=The CBS \"Cold Case\" Files|first=Sherrie|last=Gossett|date=13 May 2005|accessdate=15 August 2010}}</ref> Subsequent investigation revealed that \\'\\'60 Minutes\\'\\' had engineered the failure \\u2013 fitting a canister of compressed air on the passenger-side floor, linked via a hose to a hole drilled into the transmission.<ref name=\"debacle\"/>\\n\\n[[File:Mint Audi 100 (1982-91) (10629216834).jpg|thumb|[[Audi 100]] C3, sold as the [[Audi 5000]] in the U.S.]]\\n\\nAudi contended, prior to findings by outside investigators,<ref name=\"renamed\"/> that the problems were caused by driver error, specifically pedal misapplication.<ref name=\"renamed\"/>  Subsequently, the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) concluded that the majority of unintended acceleration cases, including all the ones that prompted the \\'\\'60 Minutes\\'\\' report, were caused by driver error such as confusion of pedals.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=highbeam com|work=The Washington Post|date=16 April 1989|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1185635.html | title=Unfair at Any Speed|first=Brock |last=Yates|accessdate=15 August 2010}}</ref>  CBS did not acknowledge the test results of involved government agencies, but did acknowledge the similar results of another study.<ref name=\"huber\"/>\\n\\nIn a review study published in 2012, NHTSA summarized its past findings about the Audi unintended acceleration problems: \"Once an unintended acceleration had begun, in the Audi 5000, due to a failure in the idle-stabilizer system (producing an initial acceleration of 0.3g), pedal misapplication resulting from panic, confusion, or unfamiliarity with the Audi 5000 contributed to the severity of the incident.\"<ref name=\"nhtsa2012\">{{cite news | title = Pedal Application Errors | date = March 2012 | url = http://www.nhtsa.gov/staticfiles/nti/pdf/811597.pdf | accessdate=3 December 2013}}</ref>\\n\\nThis summary is consistent with the conclusions of NHTSA\\'s most technical analysis at the time: \"Audi idle-stabilization systems were prone to defects which resulted in excessive idle speeds and brief unanticipated accelerations of up to 0.3g [which is similar in magnitude to an emergency stop in a subway car].

Produced from 1999 to 2005, the [[Audi A2]] was a futuristic super mini, born from the Al2 concept, with many features that helped regain consumer confidence, like the aluminium [[space frame]], which was a first in production car design. In the A2 Audi further expanded their TDI technology through the use of frugal three-cylinder engines. The A2 was extremely aerodynamic and was designed around a [[wind tunnel]]. The Audi A2 was criticised for its high price and was never really a sales success but it planted Audi as a cutting-edge manufacturer. The model, a [[Mercedes-Benz A-Class]] competitor, sold relatively well in Europe. However, the A2 was discontinued in 2005 and Audi decided not to develop an immediate replacement.\\n\\nThe next major model change came in 1995 when the [[Audi A4]] replaced the [[Audi 80]]. The new nomenclature scheme was applied to the Audi 100 to become the [[Audi A6]] (with a minor facelift). This also meant the S4 became the [[Audi S6|S6]] and a new S4 was introduced in the A4 body. The S2 was discontinued. The [[Audi Cabriolet]] continued on (based on the Audi 80 platform) until 1999, gaining the engine upgrades along the way. A new [[Audi A3|A3]] [[hatchback]] model (sharing the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk4]]\\'s platform) was introduced to the range in 1996, and the radical [[Audi TT]] [[coup\\xe9]] and [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]] were debuted in 1998 based on the same underpinnings.\\n\\nThe engines available throughout the range were now a 1.4&nbsp;L, 1.6&nbsp;L and 1.8&nbsp;L four-cylinder, 1.8&nbsp;L four-cylinder turbo, 2.6&nbsp;L and 2.8&nbsp;L [[V6 engine|V6]], 2.2&nbsp;L turbo-charged five-cylinder and the 4.2&nbsp;L [[V8 engine]]. The V6s were replaced by new 2.4&nbsp;L and 2.8&nbsp;L 30V V6s in 1998, with marked improvement in power, torque and smoothness. Further engines were added along the way, including a 3.7&nbsp;L V8 and 6.0&nbsp;L [[W12 engine]] for the A8.\\n\\n===Audi AG today===\\nAudi\\'s sales grew strongly in the 2000s, with deliveries to customers increasing from 653,000 in 2000 to 1,003,000 in 2008. The largest sales increases came from Eastern Europe (+19.3%), Africa (+17.2%) and the Middle East (+58.5%). China in particular has become a key market, representing 108,000 out of 705,000 cars delivered in the first three quarters of 2009. One factor for its popularity in China is that Audis have become the car of choice for purchase by the Chinese government for officials, and purchases by the government are responsible for 20% of its sales in China.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2010/10/20/audis-millionth-car-sale-shows-china-still-tops/ |title=China: Audi sells a million &#124; beyondbrics &#124; News and views on emerging markets from the Financial Times \\u2013 FT.com |publisher=Blogs.ft.com |date=20 October 2010 |accessdate=9 January 2011}}</ref> As of late 2009, Audi\\'s operating profit of \\u20ac1.17-billion ($1.85-billion) made it the biggest contributor to parent Volkswagen Group\\'s nine-month operating profit of \\u20ac1.5-billion, while the other marques in Group such as Bentley and SEAT had suffered considerable losses.<ref>{{cite news|author=Canada |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/new-cars/auto-news/audis-a-game/article1377213/ |title=Audi\\'s A game |work=The Globe and Mail |accessdate=12 March 2011 |location=Toronto}}</ref> May 2011 saw record sales for Audi of America with the new [[Audi A7]] and [[Audi A3]] TDI Clean Diesel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://larsonautomotiveblog.com/audi-has-best-may-u-s-sales-in-its-history/|title=Audi has best May U.S. sales in its history!|date=3 June 2011|publisher=Larson Automotive Group|accessdate=25 July 2012}}</ref>  In May 2012, Audi reported a 10% increase in its sales\\u2014from 408 units to 480 in the last year alone.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/article3479793.ece| title= Audi posts 10% growth in sales | date=1 June 2012}}</ref>\\n\\nAudi manufactures vehicles in seven plants around the world, some of which are shared with other VW Group marques<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.audi.com/com/brand/en/company/production_plants/aurangabad.html#source=http://www.audi.com/com/brand/en/company/production_plants.html&container=page |title=Audi Worldwide &gt; Company &gt; Production plants &gt; Aurangabad |publisher=Audi.com |date=27 August 2010 |accessdate=12 March 2011}}</ref> although many sub-assemblies such as engines and transmissions are manufactured within other Volkswagen Group plants.\\n\\nAudi\\'s two principal assembly plants are:\\n\\n* [[Ingolstadt]], Opened by Auto Union in 1964, (A3, A4, A5, Q5)\\n* [[Neckarsulm]], Acquired from NSU in 1969 (A4, A6, A7, A8, R8 & all RS variants)\\n\\nOutside of Germany, Audi produces vehicles at:\\n\\n* [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]], India since 2006\\n* [[Bratislava]], Slovakia, shared with Volkswagen, SEAT, \\u0160koda and Porsche (Q7)\\n* [[Brussels]], Belgium, acquired from Volkswagen in 2007  (A1)\\n* [[Changchun]], China since 1995\\n* [[Gy\\u0151r]], Hungary, (TT and some A3 variants)\\n* [[Jakarta]], Indonesia since 2011\\n* [[Martorell]], Spain shared with SEAT and Volkswagen (Q3)\\n* [[San Jos\\xe9 Chiapa]], Mexico (Q5)\\n\\nIn September 2012, Audi announced the construction of its first North American manufacturing plant in [[Puebla]], Mexico.

To be able to mount powerful engines (such as a V8 engine in the [[Audi S4]] and [[Audi RS4]], as well as the [[W12 engine]] in the [[Audi A8|Audi A8L W12]]), Audi has usually engineered its more expensive cars with a [[Longitudinal engine|longitudinally]] [[Front-engine design|front-mounted engine]], in an \"overhung\" position, over the front wheels in front of the axle line - this layout dates back to the DKW and Auto Union saloons from the 1950s. But while this allows for the easy adoption of all-wheel drive, it goes against the ideal 50:50 weight distribution.\\n\\nIn all its post [[Volkswagen]]-era models, Audi has firmly refused to adopt the traditional [[rear-wheel drive]] layout favored by its two archrivals [[Mercedes-Benz]] and [[BMW]], favoring either [[front-wheel drive]] or [[four-wheel drive|all-wheel drive]]. The majority of Audi\\'s lineup in the United States features all-wheel drive standard on most of its expensive vehicles (only the entry-level trims of the A4 and A6 are available with front-wheel drive), in contrast to [[Mercedes-Benz]] and [[BMW]] whose lineup treats all-wheel drive as an option. BMW did not offer all-wheel drive on its V8-powered cars (as opposed to crossover SUVs) until the 2010 BMW 7 Series and 2011 BMW 5 Series, while the Audi A8 has had all-wheel drive available/standard since the 1990s. Regarding high-performance variants, [[Audi S and RS models]] have always had all-wheel drive, unlike their direct rivals from [[BMW M]] and [[Mercedes-AMG]] whose cars are rear-wheel drive only (although their performance crossover SUVs are all-wheel drive).\\n\\nAudi has recently applied the \\'\\'[[quattro (four-wheel drive system)|quattro]]\\'\\' badge to models such as the A3 and TT which do not use the [[Torsen]]-based system as in prior years with a mechanical center differential, but with the [[Haldex Traction]] electro-mechanical clutch AWD system.\\n\\n====Engines====\\n[[File:Volkswagen W12.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Volkswagen Group]] W12 engine from the [[Volkswagen Phaeton|Volkswagen Phaeton W12]]]]\\n{{Further2|[[List of Audi vehicles#Production model engines|Audi production engines]]}}\\n\\nPrior to the introduction of the Audi 80 and Audi 50 in 1972 and 1974, respectively, Audi had led the development of the \\'\\'EA111\\'\\' and \\'\\'EA827\\'\\' [[Straight-four engine|inline-four]] engine families.  These new power units underpinned the water-cooled revival of parent company Volkswagen (in the Polo, Golf, Passat and Scirocco), whilst the many derivatives and descendants of these two basic engine designs have appeared in every generation of VW Group vehicles right up to the present day.\\n\\nIn the 1980s, Audi, along with Volvo, was the champion of the [[Straight-five engine|inline-five]] cylinder, [[Engine displacement|2.1/2.2 L]] engine as a longer-lasting alternative to more traditional six-cylinder engines. This engine was used not only in production cars but also in their race cars. The 2.1&nbsp;L inline five-cylinder engine was used as a base for the [[Rallying|rally cars]] in the 1980s, providing well over {{convert|400|hp|kW|abbr=off}} after modification. Before 1990, there were engines produced with a displacement between 2.0&nbsp;L and 2.3&nbsp;L. This range of engine capacity allowed for both fuel economy and power.\\n\\nFor the ultra-luxury version of its [[Audi A8]] fullsize luxury flagship sedan, the Audi A8L W12, Audi uses the [[Volkswagen Group]] [[list of Volkswagen Group petrol engines#W12|W12 engine]] instead of the conventional [[V12 engine]] favored by rivals Mercedes-Benz and BMW. The W12 engine configuration (also known as a \"WR12\") is created by forming two imaginary narrow-angle 15\\xb0 [[VR6 engine]]s at an angle of 72\\xb0, and the narrow angle of each set of cylinders allows just two [[overhead camshaft]]s to drive each pair of banks, so just four are needed in total.<ref name=AutoZine>{{cite web|url=http://www.autozine.org/technical_school/engine/tech_engine_packaging.htm#W12|title=Volkswagen\\'s VR6 and W-engines \\u2013 W12|first=Mark|last=Wan|work=AutoZine.org|accessdate=31 December 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100126054913/http://www.autozine.org/technical_school/engine/tech_engine_packaging.htm| archivedate= 26 January 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The advantage of the W12 engine is its compact packaging, allowing Audi to build a 12-cylinder sedan with all-wheel drive, whereas a conventional [[V12 engine]] could only have a rear-wheel drive configuration as it would have no space in the engine bay for a differential and other components required to power the front wheels. In fact, the 6.0&nbsp;L W12 in the Audi A8L W12 is smaller in overall dimensions than the 4.2&nbsp;L V8 that powers the Audi A8 4.2 variants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newcartestdrive.com/review-intro.cfm?Vehicle=2005_Audi_A8&ReviewID=2934 |title=2005 Audi A8 Review and Photos |publisher=New Car Test Drive |accessdate=18 November 2011}}</ref> The 2011 Audi A8 debuted a revised 6.3-litre version of the W12 (WR12) engine with {{convert|500|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}.\\n\\n====Fuel Stratified Injection====\\nNew models of the A3, A4, A6 and A8 have been introduced, with the ageing 1.8-litre engine now having been replaced by new [[Gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI) engines. Nearly every petroleum burning model in the range now incorporates this fuel-saving technology.\\n\\n[[File:2007 Audi R8 Engine.JPG|thumb|V8 FSI engine]]\\n\\n====Direct-Shift Gearbox====\\nAt the turn of the century, Volkswagen introduced the [[Direct-Shift Gearbox]] (DSG), a type of [[dual clutch transmission]]. It is an automated [[semi-automatic transmission]], drivable like a conventional [[automatic transmission]]. Based on the gearbox found in the Group B S1, the system includes dual electrohydraulically controlled [[clutch]]es instead of a [[torque converter]]. This is implemented in some [[Volkswagen Golf|VW Golfs]], [[Audi A3]], [[Audi A4]] and [[Audi TT|TT]] models where DSG is called S-tronic.\\n\\n===LED daytime running lights===\\nBeginning in 2005, Audi has implemented white [[light-emitting diode|LED]] technology as [[daytime running light]]s (DRL) in their products. The distinctive shape of the DRLs has become a trademark of sorts. LEDs were first introduced on the [[Audi A8#D3|Audi A8 W12]], the world\\'s first production car to have LED DRLs,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cargurus.com/Cars/2005-Audi-A8-Overview-c319|title=2005 Audi A8 - Overview - CarGurus|work=CarGurus|accessdate=14 July 2015}}</ref><ref>http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/5753C7B50C3435D6CA257053001CB9E4</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cars.com/audi/a8/2005/expert-reviews|title=2005 Audi A8|first=Jim|last=Flammang|publisher=|accessdate=14 July 2015}}</ref> and have since spread throughout the entire model range. The LEDs are present on some Audi [[billboard]]s.\\n\\nSince 2010, Audi has also offered the [[LED headlamp|LED technology in low- and high-beam headlights]].<ref>{{cite web|title=2010 Audi R8 LED Headlights|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/features/2010-audi-r8-led-headlights|publisher=Car and Driver|accessdate=28 January 2012}}</ref>\\n\\n[[File:LED DaytimeRunningLights.jpg|thumb|The DRL in an Audi A4 B8]]\\n\\n===Multi Media Interface===\\n[[File:Audi TT 2014 (13558812864).jpg|thumb|left|Multi Media Interface-Menu on [[Audi virtual cockpit]], [[Audi TT Mk3]]]]\\nStarting with the 2003 [[Audi A8]], Audi has used a centralised control interface for its on-board [[infotainment]] systems, called [[Multi Media Interface]] (MMI). This came amid criticism of BMW\\'s [[iDrive]] control. It is essentially a rotating control knob and \\'segment\\' buttons \\u2013 designed to control all in-car entertainment devices (radio, CD changer, iPod, TV tuner), satellite navigation, heating and ventilation, and other car controls with a screen. MMI was widely reported to be a considerable improvement on BMW\\'s iDrive, although BMW has since made their iDrive more user-friendly.\\n\\nThe availability of MMI has gradually filtered down the Audi lineup, and following its introduction on the third generation A3 in 2011, MMI is now available across the entire range.  It has been generally well received, as it requires less menu-surfing with its segment buttons around a central knob, along with \\'main function\\' direct access buttons \\u2013 with shortcuts to the radio or phone functions. The colour screen is mounted on the upright dashboard, and on the A4 (new), A5, A6, A8, and Q7, the controls are mounted horizontally.\\n\\n=== Synthetic Diesel ===\\n\\nAudi has come out with technology to produce [[synthetic diesel]] from water and [[carbon dioxide]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/392138/audi-is-making-fuel-from-air-and-water/|title=Audi is making fuel from air and water|author=Zach Wener-Fligner|work=Quartz|accessdate=14 July 2015}}</ref>\\n\\n==Models==\\n{{main article|List of Audi vehicles}}\\n\\n===Current model range===\\nThe following tables list Audi production vehicles that are sold as of 2014:\\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\\n{{col-break}}\\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\\n|+ Audi cars\\n|-\\n| [[Audi A1|A1]]\\n| [[File:2013 Audi A1 (8X MY14) 1.4 TFSI Sport S line Sportback 5-door hatchback (2015-08-07) 01.jpg|75px]]\\n| {{nowrap|Supermini}}\\n| \\n* 3-door Hatchback\\n* Sportback (5-door Hatchback)\\n|-\\n| [[Audi A3|A3]]\\n| [[File:Audi - A3 - Mondial de l\\'Automobile de Paris 2012 - 202.jpg|75px]]\\n| {{nowrap|Compact Executive Car}}\\n| \\n* 3-door Hatchback\\n* Saloon (Sedan)\\n* Sportback (5-door Hatchback)\\n* Cabriolet\\n|-\\n| [[Audi A4|A4]]\\n| [[File:Audi A4 B9 Limousine 3.0 TDI quattro.JPG|75px]]\\n| {{nowrap|Compact Executive Car}}\\n|\\n* Saloon (Sedan)\\n* Avant (Estate/Wagon)\\n* Allroad (Crossover Estate/Wagon)\\n|-\\n| [[Audi A5|A5]]\\n| [[File:2014 Audi A5 (8T MY14) 2.0 TDI quattro Sportback hatchback (2015-07-09) 01.jpg|75px]]\\n| {{nowrap|Compact Executive Car}}\\n| \\n* Coup\\xe9\\n* Sportback (5-door Hatchback)\\n* Cabriolet (Convertible)\\n|-\\n| [[Audi A6|A6]]\\n| [[File:Audi A6 Avant TDI quattro S-line (C7, Facelift) \\u2013 Frontansicht, 3.

Figures for different body types/versions of models have been merged to create overall figures for each model.\\n\\n==Motorsport==\\nAudi has competed in various forms of [[auto racing|motorsports]]. Audi\\'s tradition in motorsport began with their former company [[Auto Union]] in the 1930s. In the 1990s, Audi found success in the Touring and Super Touring categories of motor racing after success in circuit racing in North America.\\n\\n===Rallying===\\n{{Main article|Audi Sport WRC results}}\\n[[File:Portugal 84 Audi Quattro A2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Walter R\\xf6hrl]] with his Quattro A2 during the 1984 [[Rally Portugal]]]]\\nIn 1980, Audi released the [[Audi Quattro|Quattro]], a [[four-wheel drive]] (4WD) [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] car that went on to win [[rally racing|rallies]] and races worldwide. It is considered one of the most significant rally cars of all time, because it was one of the first to take advantage of the then-recently changed rules which allowed the use of four-wheel drive in competition racing. Many critics doubted the viability of four-wheel drive racers, thinking them to be too heavy and complex, yet the Quattro was to become a successful car. Leading its first rally it went off the road, however the rally world had been served notice 4WD was the future. The Quattro went on to achieve much success in the [[World Rally Championship]]. It won the [[1983 World Rally Championship season|1983]] ([[Hannu Mikkola]]) and the [[1984 World Rally Championship season|1984]] ([[Stig Blomqvist]]) [[list of World Rally Championship Drivers\\' Champions|drivers\\' titles]],<ref>{{cite web|title=World Rally Championship for Drivers \\u2013 Champions|work=RallyBase.nl|url=http://www.rallybase.nl/index.php?type=championlist&subchamptype=wcd|accessdate=30 August 2008}}</ref> and brought Audi the [[list of World Rally Championship Constructors\\' Champions|manufacturers\\' title]] in [[1982 World Rally Championship season|1982]] and 1984.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Rally Championship for Manufacturers \\u2013 Champions|work=RallyBase.nl|url=http://www.rallybase.nl/index.php?type=championlist&subchamptype=wrc|accessdate=30 August 2008}}</ref>\\n[[File:Audi Quattro - 2007 Rallye Deutschland (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Audi Quattro S1]] driven at the [[2007 Rallye Deutschland]]]]\\n\\nIn 1984, Audi launched the short-wheelbase [[Audi Quattro#Sport Quattro|Sport Quattro]] which dominated rally races in [[Monte Carlo Rally|Monte Carlo]] and [[Swedish Rally|Sweden]], with Audi taking all podium places, but succumbed to problems further into WRC contention. In [[1985 World Rally Championship season|1985]], after another season mired in mediocre finishes, [[Walter R\\xf6hrl]] finished the season in his [[Audi Quattro#Sport Quattro S1 E2|Sport Quattro S1]], and helped place Audi second in the manufacturers\\' points. Audi also received rally honours in the Hong Kong to Beijing rally in that same year. [[Mich\\xe8le Mouton]], the only female driver to win a round of the World Rally Championship and a driver for Audi, took the Sport Quattro S1, now simply called the \"S1\", and raced in the [[Pikes Peak International Hill Climb]]. The {{convert|1439|m|sing=on}} climb race pits a driver and car to drive to the summit of the {{convert|4302|m|sing=on}} [[Pikes Peak]] mountain in [[Colorado]], and in 1985, Mich\\xe8le Mouton set a new record of 11:25.39, and being the first woman to set a Pikes Peak record. In [[1986 World Rally Championship season|1986]], Audi formally left international rally racing following an accident in [[Rally Portugal|Portugal]] involving driver [[Joaquim Santos]] in his [[Ford RS200]]. Santos swerved to avoid hitting spectators in the road, and left the track into the crowd of spectators on the side, killing three and injuring 30. [[Bobby Unser]] used an Audi in that same year to claim a new record for the Pikes Peak Hill Climb at 11:09.22.\\n\\nIn 1987, Walter R\\xf6hrl claimed the title for Audi setting a new Pikes Peak International Hill Climb record of 10:47.85 in his Audi S1, which he had retired from the WRC two years earlier. The Audi S1 employed Audi\\'s time-tested [[straight-five engine|inline-five-cylinder]] turbocharged engine, with the final version generating {{convert|441|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Quattro25\">{{cite web|url=http://www.audiusanews.com/newsrelease.do?id=211|title=25 Years of Audi Quattro|work=Audi AG|accessdate=31 March 2009|date=22 February 2005|publisher=Audi Of America}}</ref>  The engine was mated to a six-speed gearbox and ran on Audi\\'s famous four-wheel drive system. All of Audi\\'s top drivers drove this car; Hannu Mikkola, Stig Blomqvist, Walter R\\xf6hrl and Mich\\xe8le Mouton. This Audi S1 started the range of Audi [[Audi S and RS models#S|\\'S\\' cars]], which now represents an increased level of sports-performance equipment within the mainstream Audi model range.\\n\\n===In the USA===\\nAs Audi moved away from rallying and into circuit racing, they chose to move first into America with the [[Trans-Am Series|Trans-Am]] in 1988.\\n\\nIn 1989, Audi moved to [[International Motor Sports Association]] (IMSA) [[IMSA GT Championship|GTO]] with the [[Audi 80|Audi 90]], however as they avoided the two major endurance events (Daytona and Sebring) despite winning on a regular basis, they would lose out on the title.\\n\\n===Touring cars===\\nIn 1990, having completed their objective to market cars in North America, Audi returned to Europe, turning first to the [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft]] (DTM) series with the [[Audi V8]], and then in 1993, being unwilling to build cars for the new formula, they turned their attention to the fast-growing [[Super Touring]] series, which are a series of national championships. Audi first entered in the [[French Supertouring Championship|French Supertourisme]] and [[Italian Superturismo Championship|Italian Superturismo]]. In the following year, Audi would switch to the German [[Super Tourenwagen Cup]] (known as STW), and then to [[British Touring Car Championship]] (BTCC) the year after that.\\n\\nThe [[F\\xe9d\\xe9ration Internationale de l\\'Automobile]] (FIA), having difficulty regulating the [[quattro (four-wheel drive system)|quattro]] four-wheel drive system, and the impact it had on the competitors, would eventually ban all four-wheel drive cars from competing in 1998,<ref name=\"Audi Motorsport\">{{cite book|last=motorsport|first=AUDI|title=Audi at Le Mans|year=February 2012|publisher=Audi-Motorsport info|page=17|url=http://www.ausmotive.com/downloads/Audi/R18-etron-quattro-press-kit.pdf}}</ref> but by then, Audi switched all their works efforts to [[sports car racing]].\\n\\nBy 2000, Audi would still compete in the US with their [[Audi RS4#B5|RS4]] for the [[SPEED World Challenge|SCCA Speed World GT Challenge]], through dealer/team [[Champion Racing]] competing against Corvettes, Vipers, and smaller BMWs (where it is one of the few series to permit 4WD cars). In 2003, Champion Racing entered an [[Audi RS6#C5|RS6]]. Once again, the quattro four-wheel drive was superior, and Champion Audi won the championship. They returned in 2004 to defend their title, but a newcomer, Cadillac with the new Omega Chassis CTS-V, gave them a run for their money. After four victories in a row, the Audis were sanctioned with several negative changes that deeply affected the car\\'s performance. Namely, added ballast weights, and Champion Audi deciding to go with different tyres, and reducing the boost pressure of the turbocharger.\\n\\nIn 2004, after years of competing with the [[Audi TT|TT-R]] in the revitalised DTM series, with privateer team Abt Racing/[[Christian Abt]] taking the 2002 title with [[Laurent A\\xefello]], Audi returned as a full factory effort to touring car racing by entering two factory supported [[Joest Racing]] [[Audi A4#Audi Sport A4 DTM|A4 DTM]] cars.\\n\\n===24 Hours of Le Mans===\\n{{Further2|[[List of Audi vehicles#Le Mans prototypes|List of Audi vehicles (Le Mans prototypes)]]}}\\n[[File:Audi R10 1.JPG|thumb|[[Audi R10 TDI]]]]\\nAudi began racing prototype sportscars in 1999, debuting at the Le Mans 24 hour. Two car concepts were developed and raced in their first season - the [[Audi R8R]] (open-cockpit \\'roadster\\' prototype) and the [[Audi R8C]] (closed-cockpit \\'coup\\xe9\\' GT-prototype). The R8R scored a credible podium on its racing debut at Le Mans and was the concept which Audi continued to develop into the 2000 season due to favourable rules for open-cockpit prototypes.\\n\\nHowever, most of the competitors (such as BMW, Toyota, Mercedes and Nissan) retired at the end of 1999.\\nThe factory-supported [[Joest Racing]] team won at Le Mans three times in a row with the Audi R8 (2000\\u20132002), as well as winning every race in the [[American Le Mans Series]] in its first year. Audi also sold the car to customer teams such as [[Champion Racing]].\\n\\nIn 2003, two [[Bentley Speed 8]]s, with engines designed by Audi, and driven by Joest drivers \\'\\'loaned\\'\\' to the fellow [[Volkswagen Group]] company, competed in the GTP class, and finished the race in the top two positions, while the Champion Racing R8 finished third overall, and first in the LMP900 class. Audi returned to the winner\\'s podium at the 2004 race, with the top three finishers all driving R8s: Audi Sport Japan Team Goh finished first, Audi Sport UK Veloqx second, and Champion Racing third.\\n\\nAt the [[2005 24 Hours of Le Mans]], Champion Racing entered two R8s, along with an R8 from the Audi PlayStation Team [[Oreca]]. The R8s (which were built to old LMP900 regulations) received a narrower air inlet restrictor, reducing power, and an additional {{convert|50|kg|0|abbr=on}} of weight compared to the newer LMP1 chassis. On average, the R8s were about 2\\u20133&nbsp;seconds off pace compared to the [[Pescarolo Sport|Pescarolo]]\\u2013[[Judd (engine)|Judd]]. But with a team of excellent drivers and experience, both Champion R8s were able to take first and third, while the Oreca team took fourth. The Champion team was also the first American team to win Le Mans since the Gulf Ford GTs in 1967. This also ends the long era of the R8; however, its replacement for 2006, called the [[Audi R10 TDI]], was unveiled on 13 December 2005.\\n\\nThe R10 [[Turbocharged Direct Injection|TDI]] employed many new and innovative features, the most notable being the [[twin-turbo]]charged [[Direct fuel injection|direct injection]] [[diesel engine]]. It was first raced in the [[2006 12 Hours of Sebring]] as a race-test in preparation for the [[2006 24 Hours of Le Mans]], which it later went on to win. Audi has been on the forefront of sports car racing, claiming a historic win in the first diesel sports car at 12 Hours of Sebring (the car was developed with a Diesel engine due to ACO regulations that favor diesel engines). As well as winning the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] in 2006 making history, the R10 TDI has also shown its capabilities by beating the [[Peugeot 908 HDi FAP]] in {{24hLM|2007}}, and beating Peugeot again in {{24hLM|2008}}, (however Peugeot won the 24h in 2009) and, in a podium clean-sweep by proving its reliability throughout the race (compared to all four 908 entries retired before the end of the race) while breaking a new distance record (set way back by the [[Porsche 917]]K of [[Martini Racing]] in {{24hLM|1971}}), in {{24hLM|2010}} with the [[Audi R15 TDI|R15 TDI Plus]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.joest-racing.de/web/news/news.php?id=541&sprache=e | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110719050259/http://www.joest-racing.de/web/news/news.php?id=541&sprache=e | archivedate = 19 July 2011 | title = Audi achieves record victory at Le Mans with new technology  | work=joest-racing.de; [[Audi Sport]] | publisher=Joest Racing | date = 13 June 2010 | accessdate =16 June 2010}}</ref>\\n\\nAudi\\'s sports car racing success would continue with the [[Audi R18]]\\'s victory at the [[2011 24 Hours of Le Mans]].

This was a successful operation with the team winning on its debut in the series at the 2000 12 Hours of Sebring. Factory backed Audi R8s were the dominant car in ALMS taking 25 victories between 2000 and the end of the 2002 season. In 2003 Audi sold customer cars to [[Champion Racing]] as well as continuing to race the factory Audi Sport North America team. Champion Racing won many races as a private team running Audi R8s and eventually replaced Team Joest as the Audi Sport North America between 2006 and 2008. Since 2009 Audi has not taken part in full American Le Mans Series Championships, but has competed in the series opening races at Sebring, using the 12-hour race as a test for Le Mans, and also as part of the [[2012 FIA World Endurance Championship season]] calendar.\\n\\n====Results====\\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%;\"\\n|-\\n!

The factory team Audi Sport UK won races and the championship in the 2004 season but Audi was unable to match their sweeping success of Audi Sport North America in the American Le Mans Series, partly due to the arrival of a factory competitor in LMP1, Peugeot. The French manufacturer\\'s [[Peugeot 908 HDi FAP|908 HDi FAP]] became the car to beat in the series from 2008 onwards with 20 LMP wins. However, Audi were able to secure the championship in 2008 even though Peugeot scored more race victories in the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2008/09/16/audi-wins-everything-add-european-le-mans-to-the-list/|title=Audi wins everything... add European Le Mans Series to the list|first=Jonathon|last=Ramsey|work=Autoblog|accessdate=14 July 2015}}</ref>\\n\\n====Results====\\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%;\"\\n|-\\n!

In the 15-second \"Future\" ad, viewers see the potential for clean diesel as today\\'s leading alternative fuel solution and an intelligent choice for those on the leading-edge. Audi TDI provides drivers with 30% better fuel economy and range without compromises on performance and design.
